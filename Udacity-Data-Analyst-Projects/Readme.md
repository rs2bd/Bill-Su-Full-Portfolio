This folder contains all projects I have completed when taking the Data Analyst Nano Degree Program at Udacity. The certification of the nanodegree is also displayed in this folder. 

Overall, the Udacity Nanodegree program is composed of 7 major segments, ranging from basic statistics to advanced machine learning and data visualization. Please feel free to contact me at su20yu1919@gmail.com if you have any questions about any of those projects. Thanks!
