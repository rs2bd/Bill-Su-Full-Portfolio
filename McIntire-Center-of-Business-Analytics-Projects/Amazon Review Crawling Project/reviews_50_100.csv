"Hakko CHP-170 Micro Soft Wire Cutter, 1.5mm Stand-off, Flush Cut, 2.5mm Hardened Carbon Steel Construction, 21-Degree Angled Jaw, 8mm Jaw Length, 16 Gauge Maximum Cutting Capacity",4.8,Pri,"I use it to snip the ends off of hobby electronics parts, i.e. resistors and component leads. There's a warning on the handle that says to only cut copper wire, but I've been cutting other stuff with it too... this has caused the blades to pit a little, but it still cuts effortlessly. Definitely make sure you're wearing safety glasses, sometimes pieces of wire will go flying at Mach 1 across the room, I learned this the hard way.",4.37,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 15, 2016",Wear your safety glasses!,Yes,,,71
"IRWIN Tools VISE-GRIP Multi Tool Stripper, Cutter and Crimper, 8-Inch (2078309)",4.6,Pri,"So far I've only used it to strip the coating from solid 22awg hook-up wire. It has made stripping wire effortless. The construction is, as expected from Vise-Grip, absolutely solid... I was surprised by how hefty this feels in the hand! I was able to use the plier portion to easily twist a few hook-up wires together. I was able to cut through wire easily using the built-in wire cutter. Overall a very solid tool.",13.49,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 15, 2016",Does what it's supposed to and does it well.,Yes,,,70
"Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Stereo Turntable System, Silver",4.4,Pri," Length:: 0:52 Mins<br/><br/></span> I really wanted to get into the world of vinyl, but I'm also broke thanks to outrageous, high-interest student loan debt. My compromise was to purchase an affordable, well-rated turntable. I did a bit of research and this turntable seemed to pop up everywhere I looked. Of course the high-end, Porsche-driving, scotch-sipping, self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" (no offense) scoffed at this every chance they got because it didn't cost $3000+ like their turntable did. But you know what? It works, and, personally, I think it looks really nice. Its minimalistic design makes it very easy to set up and it came with the adapters I needed to hook it up directly to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027VT6V4"">Cyber Acoustics Powered Speakers, (CA-3602a)</a>. I didn't have to buy any additional amplifiers or receivers. I got it hooked up in less than 5 minutes and threw on a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041TM5OU"">Kind of Blue (180g Vinyl)</a> that I had received as a gift from my sister. And it sounded, to me, phenomenal. I have extremely sensitive hearing and I can pick up on the subtle scratches that it makes, and I love it. Music from a vinyl record just sounds so...warm. Anyways, it is fully automatic, so once you hit the start button it'll go until the end of that side of the record then the arm will automatically return and the turntable will stop spinning. This is nice because I can throw on a record before bed and fall asleep while it plays.<br/><br/>Now, here's why it only got 4 stars:<br/>I returned the first one because the platter had a terrible wobble to it. I could visually see the stylus moving up and down, almost violently. At first I thought maybe my record was warped, but it was happening with all of them. It wasn't affecting the sound at all, but I was afraid of what it would do to my vinyls. I quickly received a replacement... and it has the same problem (although not as bad)! Like I said, it's not affecting the sound quality at all, but it just seems like poor quality control, even at the low price point of this turntable. I still very much enjoy listening to it daily, and I do still recommend it to anyone getting into the hobby that can't afford a super expensive turntable.<br/><br/>(The video I posted does have sound, but keep it mind it was recorded using my phone)",98.00,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 15, 2016",Great for starters...,Yes,3,2,69
"Kurgo Tru-Fit Smart Dog Harness, Extra-Large, Black",4.3,Pri,"This is the only harness I've purchased for my 85lb rescue black lab that hasn't been chewed apart in a week. The only issue I have with it is that it's really hard to keep centered on him, no matter how much I adjust it. It always leans to one side or the other, especially when there's a leash attached. I constantly have to stop and re-adjust it and try to center it. I can't comment on the seat-belt strap thing that comes with it because I lost that within a few days, but it's a nice concept.",22.27,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 15, 2016",He has yet to chew it apart.,Yes,3,2,68
Aoyue 486 Benchtop Solder Smoke Absorber,3.9,Pri,"Does not work nearly as well as I had hoped it would. I live in an apartment and have all my hobby electronics stuff in one of the bedrooms. I also live in the Midwest, which means I'm unable to open my windows from November through April because it's too cold outside... and from June to September because it's too hot outside. I was hoping this absorber would, at the very least, keep solder fumes away from my face. It does not. I keep it less than 5 inches away from where I'm doing the soldering and I still end up with a lung full of nasty fumes. I had high hopes for this thing because it sounds like it would really move some air, but my computer fans move more air than this thing. I think I'm just going to purchase another Hamilton Beach air purifier and keep it at my workstation.<br/><br/>Also, the entire thing is plastic except for the little cage that holds the charcoal pads in place.",35.99,2.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 15, 2016",Not worth it.,Yes,3,2,67
"Woods 0151 18/2 SPT-2 Clamp Lamp Light w/ 8.5-Inch Reflector, 150-Watt, 6-Foot Cord",4,Pri,"I use this behind my TV to throw a white light against the wall and help cut down on eyestrain. It works great for that. The outside edges were a bit bent when it arrived, but it doesn't affect what I'm using it for. The clamp on it is strong, in fact it's too strong for me to clip it anywhere on the TV so I just have it sitting on the TV stand.",12.50,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 5, 2016",Decent little reflector.,Yes,3,2,66
Company of Animals Nina Ottosson Dog Brick Interactive Game,4.3,Pri,"Finally, a toy that my rescued black lab doesn't get bored with after the first 5 minutes. He LOVES this thing, mainly because he knows it means food, but still. And I like it because it forces him to slow down when eating, and keeps him stimulated by making him work for his food. Although, the first times, he did start chewing on the white plastic bones after he was all done with his food.",31.12,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 5, 2016",Helps him slow down when eating.,Yes,1,1,65
"EZ-DUZ-IT 3028 Deluxe Can Opener with Grips, Black",4.4,Pri,"My dad will insist that generic items are just as good as their brand name counterparts... maybe the real lesson he is trying to teach me is that he doesn't know everything, because I can tell you for certain that this brand name can opener blows away anything you'll find at W*l-Mart. All my adult life I was under the impression that, perhaps, the can opener as we know it is just a bad design. Turns out I was just buying awful can openers. I couldn't complain too much (or so I thought) because I was only paying like $1.99... however I was paying this every few months because the teeth on the gears, or, more importantly, the cutting disk would wear out/rust.<br/><br/>Seriously, this thing slices open can tops like a hot American-made knife through butter. I have been recommending it to everyone I know.",8.43,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"January 5, 2016",Never realized what I was missing out on.,Yes,1,1,64
"Ohio Wholesale Vintage Bath Advertising Wall Art, from our Americana Collection, from our Americana Collection",4.5,Pri,"I was very surprised by the high quality of this sign given the fairly low price that I paid for it. The whole thing is made of wood! I have it hanging in my bathroom, above the toilet, using two large 3M Command Strips. It's pretty light in weight so the Command strips haven't had any issues holding it place. No issues with the sign being in a high humidity area like my bathroom, either.",16.50,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 15, 2015",Surprisingly good quality.,Yes,1,1,63

My HTC One M8 goes from 0 to 80% in ... well I don't know the exact time but goodness is it so much faster than any other charger that I've had (and I've had A LOT). The only thing that could make it better would be if it had two ports, but I didn't purchase the one with two ports so I can't fault the product.<br/><br/>I also use it to charge my Kindle HDX quicker than the 5W Amazon charger that I have.",16.50,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 15, 2015",So quick!,Yes,1,1,62
"Sparco Marker Board, Melamine Surface, 8-1/2 x 11 Inches, White (SPR75620)",4.3,Pri,"I am a very forgetful person... For example, if I don't write down that I already paid my rent for next month I'll experience an ""oh s**t!"" moment about 3 days after the due date, second-guessing myself on whether I paid my rent or not. That's where this thing comes in handy for me. I have it stuck to my fridge and I have all my monthly bills written on there with little check boxes. Each month all I change is the month name at the top and remove the check boxes from the previous month. I have a TON of monthly bills (thanks student loans!), yet I can still write them all out on the small board and still have a little bit of room leftover to add random things like certain groceries I want to get.<br/><br/>So far no late bills and no more wondering if my lights are gonna get shut off!",3.31,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 12, 2015",Don't know how I lived without it.,Yes,1,0,61
"Thyroid Support Supplement for Hypothyroidism - (Vegetarian) - A Complex Blend of Vitamin B12, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Ashwagandha Root, Copper, &amp; More - 30 Day Supply",4.3,Pri,"I thought I'd give this a try after reading all the great reviews on here, however I'm not convinced. I think most, if not all, the reviewers are experiencing a placebo effect. If you think you really have an underactive thyroid, go see a doctor. They will prescribe you with actual medication that has gone through years and years of clinical research and hundreds of trials. This stuff isn't even regulated by the FDA, yet I still bought it because I wanted to believe all the reviewers that this would be my one-stop shop for all my ailments. My chronic fatigue - did not change. My appetite - did not change. My sensitivity to cold - did not change...  Basically none of the stuff that was promised actually happened.",29.97,2.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 12, 2015",No change.,Yes,1,0,60

Satisfaction or your money back GUARANTEED,4.5,Pri,"As a 30 year old male that was beginning to show symptoms of Low-T I thought I'd give this product a shot, especially considering all the rave reviews on here. I can, however, without a doubt say that this product did nothing for me. If anything, I felt worse after taking these pills! None of the ingredients contained within have shown any definitive evidence of boosting blood testosterone levels. For me, this was one expensive placebo that didn't work.",59.95,2.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 12, 2015",Positive reviews most likely a placebo effect.,Yes,4,2,59
"Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Pacific Stream Canine Formula with Smoked Salmon, 30-Pound Bag",4.6,Pri,"This is the only food that my rescued black lab can eat without throwing up every couple of days. I tried four or five other types and it never failed that he would throw up every 3 or 4 days. Ever since I switched him to this he has not throw up even once! Not to mention he absolutely loves this food! As an added bonus, his coat looks absolutely majestic!

"Cascade Platinum Actionpacs, Fresh Scent, 65 Count",4.8,Pri,"I want to preface this by saying that I am extremely lazy and also very frugal. Therefore I only run my dishwasher about once, maybe twice a week. I pack that thing to the brim... I mean, seriously, there are dishes on top of other dishes and I'm really surprised that the top shelf hasn't collapsed from the weight. The upside to not using my dishwasher often is that I save a lot of money because I don't have to use as much water/detergent/rinse aid, etc. The downside is that my nasty dishes, with caked on food and grease, will sit in the dishwasher and dry out, making the stains semi-permanent. This becomes a non-issue though with the Cascade Platinum packs. I throw one of these bad boys in the dispenser and let the dishwasher do its thing and my dishes come out spotless over and over again. Granted, occasionally, I will find a small stain or two still on there, but I blame myself and my dish-stacking for that.",16.89,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"November 12, 2015",Perfect for the lazy.,Yes,1,1,57

It is considerably cheaper than the Samsung branded toner and I haven't noticed any issues with print quality. The instructions were slightly unclear and at one point I found myself looking for a piece (that I thought I was supposed to remove from the new toner cartridge) that didn't exist. I can't speak to the longevity of the cartridge yet seeing as how I don't print too many pages in a given week, but I'll update my review as necessary if the toner doesn't last.

SatisPet Large Dog Toys Indestructible &amp; Irresistible Chew Rope Toy for Aggressive Chewers X-Large 24-Inch in Green and Red - #1 Best Recommended Tug Rope For Large And Medum Sized Dogs,4.4,Pri,This is the only rope he hasn't been able to completely chew through yet.

"iXCC Dual USB 4.8 Amp 24W Universal High Capacity Car Charger for Apple, Samsung, Android and Windows Smartphones and Tablets - Silver",4.4,Pri,"The benefit of having to use your own cords is that you can charge different types of devices at the same time. I can charge just about any electronics that I have while she charges her apples. And you dictate how long of a cord you want to use. It doesn't seem to charge as quickly as my ""QuickCharge 2.0"" standard home charger, but it's faster than my previous car charger which would take hours. The small size is great and can be hidden away. Also the little blue light is a nice touch because some car outlets continue to draw power after the car is off while others don't and this is a good way to see which ones do.",17.99,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"August 10, 2015",Nice and compact,Yes,6,6,54
BMW genuine fuel filler cap,4.5,Pri,"2006 330xi. This cap looks and fits differently than the stock gas cap that I had. My original had a large, green rubber seal, this one does not. But, this one fits and actually clicks into place, whereas the original had lost some spring tension and would always ""un-click"", causing my SEL to come on every few days this past winter. And yes, it is a genuine BMW part. I think it's the one that comes stock on the Z4, perhaps? Either way, it works.<br/><br/>My SEL has not come on even once since I installed this cap a few months ago.",22.50,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"April 12, 2015",Works on BMW E90,Yes,6,6,53
TYC 700218 Replacement Blower Assembly for BMW,4.6,Pri,"Perfect replacement for the rusted out blower on my 2006 330XI. I can't fix the water leak that caused the original to rust and seize up, but this one has its guts encased in plastic, so I'm hoping it'll last much longer. Not sure what noise the other reviewer is referring to, maybe they installed it improperly because the only noise I hear is from air rushing through my vents at a very high speed.<br/><br/>The installation is a pain, especially if you're like me and go about it the lazy way by just going under the glove box instead of removing it.",77.08,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"March 1, 2015",Perfect replacement in 2006 330xi,Yes,6,6,52

TCL 50FS5600 50-Inch 1080p LED TV (2014 Model),4.2,Pri,"See updates at the end!<br/><br/>The only low ratings so far are from people that don't understand the purpose of a product review and decided to give 1 star because they had an issue with the seller they bought it from. Those people should not be allowed to internet. Now, ranting aside, I bought this TV after many price and feature comparisons and I could not be any happier.<br/><br/>A few reasons I chose this TV:<br/><br/>3 HDMI inputs. Most of the other 50 inch TVs were not only higher priced, but had only 2 HDMI inputs. I needed 3 so I could connected DISH, Chromecast, and PS3.<br/><br/>Decent built-in speakers. I don't remember the exact wattage, but I think this has 2- 8 watt speakers. Which, of course can't compare to a sound system, but isn't bad for built-in speakers. The other TVs I researched had 6 or 7 watts.<br/><br/>Manufacture date. This might seem kind of trivial, but it's important. This TV model was released this year, which means they had time to improve any bugs, issues, or complaints from the model that was released last year. My specific set shows a manufactured on date of April 2014.<br/><br/>1080p and 120hz and 50 freakin' inches! Those 3 features, at a price below $500.<br/><br/>Initial thoughts upon arrival:<br/>At first I thought they might have sent me a refurbished TV... I'm still not convinced that isn't the case, but I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning such a huge item, plus I bought the extra warranty from square trade which adds an additional 3 years to the already present 1 year manufacturer's warranty. I say it was refurbished (or returned) because of small clues like the glass base having fingerprints all over it and the batteries for the remote being lose in the ziplock bag that had the remote and instruction manual. The fingerprints are easily cleaned as they were on a plastic covering on the glass base. The batteries work. Used or not the TV works wonderfully.<br/>The TV itself looks really nice. It's extremely thin and the bezel on the bottom isn't annoying like it is on most TVs I've owned. The glass base is a nice touch of class as well. The picture looks great and I love the dynamic backlight feature that automatically raises and lowers the backlight of the TV, depending on what's on the screen, to conserve power. This TV has a VERY bright backlight. I actually turned mine all the way down to 0.<br/><br/>I'll update if there are any issues that make me want to lower the rating, but for now I fully recommend this TV if you're in the market.<br/><br/>7/15 - I was watching Sherlock on Netflix and all of a sudden I noticed a black line running from top to bottom about 5 inches from the left of the TV... I thought maybe it was an issue with my Chromecast, so I switched to a different input and it was still there. It's a TV issues. I've contacted customer support. If they have a terrible response I will lower the rating as necessary, but as it stands this is still a good TV.<br/><br/>7/18 - TCL customer service emailed me back, but they weren't very helpful. I guess they didn't fully understand my issue. I replied to their reply and they wrote back a few hours later, which is awesome turnaround. They advised that since it had only been like two weeks since I got the TV, I should return it to Amazon. I was tempted to return it and just get a refund, but I opted for a replacement instead. The TV is beautifully designed and I don't want to get rid of it completely. I lowered my rating to 4 stars, because there is really no excuse for a two week old TV to have dead pixels. Hopefully it was just bad luck and not a sign of the durability of this TV. I'll update if more issues arise.<br/><br/>7/22 - I received my replacement from Amazon... now my suspicions about the 1st set being used have been confirmed! In this one, the batteries were not loose, they were packaged in plastic. Also, the big giveaway was that when I turned the TV on for the first time it had me go through a setup process where I chose my timezone and tv signal type. So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels with this one, and I've definitely been looking harder than I did with the 1st TV.",39.00,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"July 8, 2014",No buyer's remorse here!,Yes,,,49
3 American Flag Aviator Sunglasses 3 Pairs,4.1,Pri,"I bought these specifically for Stagecoach Music Festival, which is a huge country music festival in California.

"Voltaic Systems 4.0W ""Amp"" 1018-S Portable Solar Charger and 4000mAh USB Battery Backup Bank for iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy, Android, and USB Devices",4.1,Pri,"The day after I got this charger, I was at Fort Riley, KS. Living outside for no less than 11 days. In that time I accidentally put this thing through the wringer, and it came out like a champ...<br/><br/>Story time: I mostly kept this charger on top of the truck while the hot Kansas sun beat down upon us out in the field. If I got the angle just right, I could have the battery fully charged by nightfall, but even with a half charge it's more than enough to keep my cellphone going. I used the charger to also charge another portable (1,000mAh) battery that I have. One day, I had placed the charger, with the included battery, on the roof of one of the trucks. Being sleep-deprived and hungry, I forgot all about it... and we ended up taking the truck into town... with the charger still on top. Queue to 2 hours later, we're still in town, and all of a sudden there's a torrential downpour. I mean, streets were flash flooding. By the time we got back to the field is when I remembered that I had left my charger top of the truck, luckily it was still there, but it was COMPLETELY soaked inside and out. I pressed the button on the battery and it lit up and then quickly shutoff. I tried pressing it again and got no response from the battery this time around. I was a bit bummed thinking that I had just ruined $100. I decided to leave it out in the sun the next day to see if maybe it would dry out. When the sun hit the panels, the battery started flashing the lights as if it was charging... but it was very erratic. It would tell me the battery is full and when I disconnected it, it would just flash random lights. Clearly I had ruined it by getting it soaked, right? ... Nope! I let it sit in the sun, connected to the panels, for a whole day without touching it, and by the end of that day it was operating as normal!<br/><br/>I took away one star because the micro-usb pin that attaches to the USB out cable is ridiculously easy to lose. Mine is sitting in tall grass in the fields of Kansas. They sell new ones on their website, but I'll just use one of the 30 USB to Mini-USB cables I have lying around from all my phone chargers.<br/><br/>Also, I think it takes the battery a few cycles to become efficient at being charged.",79.00,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"June 29, 2014",Beyond durable...,Yes,2,2,47
"West Paw Design Zogoflex Tux Guaranteed Tough Treat Stuffable Dog Chew Toy, Tangerine",4.5,Pri,"Dtango, my rescue black lab, has a terrible habit of eating his food way too quickly. This habit results in weekly upset stomachs and occasional vomiting of entire bits of kibble. The Tux toy has helped a little bit to alleviate this problem... I use it in combination with a slow-feed bowl. What I do is fill the center with food and place the entire thing on top of his bowl which I've placed a little bit of food in as well. He's forced to eat only a few pieces at a time and he actually chews them now.",15.50,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"May 26, 2014",I use it to feed my dog,Yes,2,2,46
"Safari® Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush, Large",4.5,Pri,"It was great while it lasted (about 3 months)... eventually the pins became severely bent to the point of actually causing my dog discomfort. I think it was most likely caused by the self-cleaning part of the brush. When you push the little button out, there's nothing to guarantee that it will return in a perfectly straight manner instead of slightly off-center... not sure if that makes sense, but basically the brush caused the pins to bend and once a single pin is bent the rest are just a matter of time. I will most likely buy it again because my dog did enjoy being brushed by it and it appeared to help a little bit with his shedding, but I'll keep it out of careless hands.",9.99,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"May 26, 2014",It was nice while it lasted,Yes,1,1,45

Mann-Filter CUK 8430 Cabin Filter With Activated Charcoal for select BMW models,4.9,Pri,"The price is unbeatable and the filter fits my '06 330xi perfectly. I replace it about once a year, before the service indicator goes off, but this year I had to replace it twice because there was so much road salt dust in the air that the service indicator came on a lot sooner than usual. The biggest tip I can offer is to make absolutely sure that you put the housing back in place perfectly, otherwise you'll have water leak into the cabin, through the blower motor, and into the carpet on the passenger's side... I know from experience.",19.49,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"March 10, 2014",What hasn't already been said?,Yes,1,1,43
"Flexi Durabelt Retractable Belt Dog Leash, Large/Extra Large, 16-Feet Long, Supports up to 150-Pound, Black",4.4,Pri,"I rescued a 2/3 year old black lab a few weeks ago and boy is he strong! He doesn't pull on his leash unless he sees a small animal, in which case he'll take off at full speed... This thing, amazingly, has held up to his sudden sprints. I almost feel bad because he gets to the end of the length of leash and gets pulled back a bit depending on how much I've braced myself. I like this leash because it lets me let him roam around a bit but I can hit the lock button if he's starting to get too far away or if he's about to get wrapped around a tree or something. It comes with a little safety collar thing, but I don't remember seeing clear instructions on exactly how to use it... it's supposed to prevent you from getting whipped in the face if your dog's collar breaks and this comes retracting back at you at full speed.",14.42,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"March 10, 2014",Holding up well so far...,Yes,6,6,42

The cover has magnets that keep it shut and turn of the kindle's back-light, but there's also a little spandex-type band that you close around the lid. There's a spandex loop that sticks out to store a pen. There are cutouts for the speakers and controls. There's a few random pockets on the inside of the cover, looks like they'd hold a business card and maybe one holds an SD card? I'm not really sure how useful those are.<br/><br/>My only issue with the case is that it stands vertical... in the pictures it shows you fold back the cover and the kindle will sit at an angle, mine most certainly does not sit at an angle but rather straight up. It makes table-top view annoying if not difficult. But, like I said, for the price I can't really complain about it too much and I end up just leaning the kindle against something if I want to watch a movie without holding it.",14.95,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"March 10, 2014",Can't really beat the price.,Yes,,,41
"L/XL Black Anti-Pull Mesh Dog Harness Fits Necks 16""-26""",4.2,Pri,"When you adjust this harness to fit your dog, the part where your leash connects hangs loose. Now this has its up and downs. The good thing is that it lets you walk next to your dog without pressure on the dog from the leash. The bad part is that if you take your eye off your dog for even a minute, he or she will chew right through that part of the harness as my lab did when I thought he was just laying down. There has to be a better way to design this harness so that it's adjustable but doesn't have that thin portion hanging like that. That part of the harness also prevented me from leaving the harness on him when I was unleashing him because it flopped around and the metal ring would whip around and hit him.<br/><br/>I really did like this harness until he chewed it up, because the part where his legs rub was nice and soft so I didn't have to worry about him being rubbed raw from long walks.

"Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag",4.2,Pri,"The 2/3 year old black lab that I rescued a couple of weeks ago is my first real pet. Before I went and picked him up from the shelter, I did a *TON* of research on different foods/treats/toys/medicines... everything. After extensive research on the food, I opted to go with this one. Of course, the flavor you choose will change things a bit, but for the most part this food is well made and well-digested. I haven't had any issues with my dog refusing to eat, in fact, if anything, he always wants more! Every now and then I'll grab a few kibbles and trick him into thinking they're treats.<br/>So why did I choose this over say Blue Buffalo? Well... this company makes all those premium dog foods, but this line costs significantly less. The ingredients are all things that are recommended for dogs, nothing that is known to be terrible for them. I like that the chicken one has chicken as the first two ingredients, and not chicken by-products either... I've noticed that all of the cheaper foods have by-products. This food has a relatively high protein content when compared to other foods and he seems to be handling it really well. His coat has a nice shine to it now, but honestly I don't know if that's just because I got him from a shelter and he is in a better environment now.<br/><br/>I did, however, read about how this company had several recalls on food, but that is a risk you take with any food product that purchase and don't prepare yourself, even human foods. The best thing to do is sign up with websites that notify you right away whenever there is a pet food recall. The recall didn't seem to affect all of their products, and only applied to certain plants (they have plants in a few states in the US).",39.51,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"March 10, 2014",Did a lot of research before buying...,Yes,3,3,35

He comes running up to me as soon as he hears me opening the bag. The nice thing is that these don't smell awful like most other treats. He doesn't eat any other hard/crunchy treats, but, like I said, he loves these. The ingredients list is super simple and doesn't have any ridiculous chemicals that I have to Google.

N/A,N/A,Pri,"My engine would randomly start to misfire after slowing down during a long drive... The car would shake terrible and accelerate very poorly, as if it was going to just explode at any minute, but then the problem would randomly just go away as quickly as it had arrived. This wouldn't leave me enough time to check the error codes for the check engine light. One time I thought ahead during a long trip and kept my OBD reader attached and managed to catch the culprit red-handed: Misfire in cylinder 6. This problem started shortly after I had changed all of my spark plugs to the Bosch Double Platinum even though mine had come with the NGK Iridium. I thought that perhaps it was a sparkplug issue. But before I dropped $100 on all new plugs, I decided to move the coils around to see if I could isolate the issue. The next time the check engine light came on, it should a misfire in a different cylinder. It had to be the coil.<br/><br/>I ordered this one and swapped it out with the defective one in my engine and now my 2006 BMW 330XI is back to purring like a cheetah. Acceleration has improved significantly and smoothly. No more misfires. The shaking that I used to experience at start ups is all but gone, and it doesn't last nearly as much as it used to.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the clip that secures the wiring harness doesn't easily let it go when you want to remove it. You have to pry the clip off of the coil and then remove the wire, whereas on my factory installed coils the wiring harness it released as soon as I raise the clip.",14.85,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"July 29, 2013",Fixed my misfire,Yes,1,1,29
"URBAN ARMOR GEAR Case for Samsung Galaxy S III, Moss",4.6,Pri,"The case:<br/>I purchased the green one and I am really happy with it. The color is more of an 'olive drab' than green, and it looks good. The case has a rugged look to it and it feels pretty rugged too, especially with the fake little torx screws on the back (they're just bits of plastic shaped like torx screws). I have a tendency to keep my phone on my lap as I'm driving, and then step out of the car without remembering the phone is on my lap and subsequently having it fall from 3 feet or so directly onto solid asphalt, but I'm not worried about my phone getting damaged from that thanks to this case. The corners seem to be the most vulnerable on smartphones, and this case has extra padding on the corners to prevent any issues. The parts that cover the volume rocker switch and the power button are a soft rubber, allowing you to easily press the buttons. There are openings in the case for the charger port, headphone port, and both the microphones (yes, our phones have two microphones) and the openings on the back for camera, flash, and speaker.<br/><br/>Now, with all that being said, the case is a bit difficult to install. It is very stiff, and does not give much. I found that the best way to install it is to place the side of the phone with the power button into the case first and then press down on the other side and then just start pressing all the way around until the phone is in. Hopefully I won't have to do a battery pull or a memory card swap any time soon because I am NOT looking forward to removing and re-installing the case, that's how much of a pain in the bottom it was.<br/><br/>The screen protector:<br/>Utterly useless. I mean, it will probably prevent a few minor surface scratches on the screen, but most likely it's not doing much than attracting fingerprints since our screens our made from Gorilla Glass anyways. The worst part is that it didn't even fit properly. I've installed many screen protectors for myself and my family and friends, so I've gotten pretty good at lining them up just right. It wasn't user error is what I'm trying to say. I've only had it for a week and it's already starting to peel. I will be replacing it with a Zagg screen protector soon though. Also, the case itself sticks out a little bit past the case, so it should protect the screen from most drops, unless you drop it onto a rock or something small that contacts the screen and not front of the case.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Good case with good protection and cool color choices, poor screen protector. The case is hard to install and remove, so keep that in mind when installing a memory card. I recommend buying this case, but also purchasing a better screen protector.",14.85,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"July 24, 2013","Good case, useless screen protector",Yes,1,1,28
Suunto Core Sport Watch: All Black,4.2,Pri,"I personally think the watch looks great. It is a bit large, and I have freakishly small wrists, but it still looks good. It's got sort of a futuristic look to it and I often get compliments on it.<br/><br/>Now for the functions... The compass is spotty at best, even after you've calibrated it by slowly rotating it in circles. Don't rely on it for exact azimuths, but it will suffice to give you a good idea your general heading; especially at night, because if you use the backlight it causes the compass reading to flash the degrees instead of changing steadily. The outer ring rotates and there is a marking on the watch face that constantly designates north when in compass mode.<br/><br/>I have yet to get the barometer or altimeter to function properly, so I can't really comment on that other than noting that I would be considered expert level when it comes to figuring out technology.<br/><br/>The thermometer is useless when you're wearing the watch because it is too greatly affected by your body heat to give you accurate reading of the ambient temperature.<br/><br/>I have often used the alarm as a wake-up, it's got a nice tone that isn't obnoxiously loud... which may not work for extremely heavy sleepers, but I've never had an issue with it not waking me up. But, just in case, I have it as a the pre-alarm to my obnoxious cellphone alarm. As it's going off it asks if you want to snooze and automatically turns the backlight on so you can read the screen in the dark. There's no setting to change the duration of the snooze.<br/><br/>The timer does splits. There is also a countdown timer as well as a sunrise/sunset time read out.<br/><br/>I've taken it under water a few feet, and through some mud, and dirt, and thick brush, there is not a single scratch on the entire watch.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a really nice and well-built watch... but if I were to spend that amount of money again on a watch, it would not be this one.",14.85,3.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"July 10, 2013","Looks great, functions ok",Yes,3,3,27
GoSports CornHole Bean Bag Toss Game Set - Superior Aluminum Frame,4.3,Pri,"We definitely got a lot of use out of this over the 4 days that I was in northern Wisconsin, however we quickly realized that the portability of this set is its greatest downfall... The aluminum simply gives way too much and causes the boards to slightly flex with each bag that lands on it, often catapulting the bags several feet behind the board. Wooden boards are really the only way to go, but those are so unwieldy and not nearly as durable as this set. The included bags are very well constructed, I don't see them coming apart any time soon even though we beat them up quite a bit.<br/><br/>At first the entire board would bounce around with each bag that hit it, but we resolved that by placing heavy water softener salt bags on the crossbar that folds down on the bottom.<br/><br/>All-in-all we did put it to a lot of use and it was easy to transport. We left it outside the whole time, even in the rain, because we weren't worried about warping or rotting like you would have to worry about with a wooden set. We had fun, but often were frustrated that skill didn't really seem to matter as much as luck did... the best bet was to try and score a direct hit right into the hole because trying to bounce it in was erratic in its execution.

Every single person that heard it was amazed that such booming sound was coming from such a little speaker, and everyone kept asking where I purchased it. We had all types of music playing through it while playing a few games of bags outside and there was not a single complaint regarding sound quality or a lack of volume. The battery could stand to be slightly better, even though it lasted several hours, but it might have been my fault for leaving the power switch on even when we weren't playing music through it.

I, because apparently I love wasting my money, purchased a different brand and had the same thing happen. The different brand lasted it a bit longer, but eventually fell apart.

I raised it to 5 stars from my original 4.<br/><br/>I bought this pack to use in my various travels. I like to pack pretty light whenever possible, but I was able to cram everything I needed for 4 days out of state, including clothes and shoes for hiking and swimming along with regular-wear clothes. The pack itself is huge. When I first opened it there was an overwhelming solvent smell to it, but I left the pack open and out in the sun for a few hours and the smell is pretty much gone.

If it fairs well on my travels, I may just replace my issued assault pack with this one for when I'm doing FTXs or other demanding activities.<br/><br/>Update: (June 27, 2013) - The pack survived my 4 day adventure to Arkansas. I was able to pack everything I needed and then some. I actually ended up packing way more things than I actually needed (it turns out jeans aren't needed when the avg. daily temps are hovering around 100*F!)

Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Camera Tripod,4.6,Pri," Length:: 3:34 Mins<br/><br/></span>The Ultrapod 2 is a surprisingly nice and extremely compact tripod.

This tripod fits in my camera bag with my camera! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JMZPJG"">Case Logic DCB-306 SLR Camera Holster (Black)</a> The tripod itself is nicely built, feels pretty solid in the hands. There is a fairly large velcro strap that will let you secure the tripod with your camera to a round object such as a pipe or a small tree trunk. The legs all have a little rubber grommet on the bottom that can help keep grip on a smooth surfaces such as tabletops. My only concern is the D-ring that the velcro strap goes through... it's made of plastic and not metal, which may or may not end up being an issue, only time will tell. Hopefully the d-ring doesn't fail as I have my camera mounted high up on a tree branch or something. The other compact tripod I was considering before I purchased this was the 'GorillaPod'... those seem decent, but I don't trust anything with flexible legs to hold up a heavy (and expensive!) DSLR camera, plus I'm sure eventually the legs on that will just get so worn out that they will flex on their own.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Extremely compact<br/>Good build<br/>Holds a fairly heavy DSLR camera without issue<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Plastic d-ring for the velcro strap could snap one day, but only time will tell<br/>Little rubber grommets on the bottoms of the legs may eventually wear out<br/><br/>Overall: I recommend this product for someone who doesn't want to lug around a huge tripod.

I know it wasn't a bad installation because when I re-installed the old screen it worked just fine (it's a cosmetic crack near the earpiece, not a function-affecting crack).

Sometimes the stuff can even leave red streaks from the increased blood flow it causes (I think there is niacin in there). Either way, the combination of the things in this kit have helped me to keep the hair I have and it helps with my dry scalp situation too. I used to flake pretty badly due to dry scalp, but this system seems to be keeping the flakes away far more than any dandruff shampoo has done.<br/><br/>Smells good.

Usually with those two qualities you sacrifice protection, but I've dropped this phone a couple of times while going to put it up to my ear (I'm 5'11"" so these were not small distances that I dropped the phone) and there is not a single mark on the phone. I like that the completely covers the corners of the phone as those seemed to be the most vulnerable areas for cosmetic damages with all the smartphones I've owned. The white color matches up nicely with the color of the phone. The only thing I don't like about the case is that it is a bit slick, but not even close to the slickness of the phone without a case, the matte, slightly rubberized feel helps a bit.

AmazonBasics Wireless Mouse with Nano Receiver,4.4,Pri,"Works great on just about any surface, I use it by having it next to me right on the couch while the computer sits on the table. The receiver that plugs into the computer is extremely tiny and can actually be stored inside the mouse! It connects easily to the receiver with a push of a button and doesn't need to re-paired constantly. My only complaint is that the mouse has an on/off switch to save battery (2 AAA type) but I always forget to use it, it would've been nice to have some sort of auto-off function that recognizes when the computer is off. It's a minor complaint and it's the only thing keep this mouse from being perfect, especially for the price. The scroll-wheel works smoothly and has gentle, tactile clicks when you use it.

Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS,4.3,Pri,"This was a great upgrade from the 120gb 5000rpm hard drive I had in my HP Pavillion TX1000. Sure my old hard drive was top of the line when I got my laptop in 2007, but it was becoming obvious that it had seen much better days. It would make creaking noises every chance that it got and boy was it slow in loading anything, especially booting into Windows.<br/><br/>Anyways... the upgrade was an easy one. I took out the old hard drive out of it's little caddy and put the new one in, along with the little piece that was attached to the end of the old hard drive (it's like a little adapter thing that lets the drive actually make a connection to the laptop). Tossed my Windows 7 setup dvd into my dvd drive and started up the laptop and did a nice, fresh, clean install of Windows 7 before upgrading to Windows 8. I didn't have to install any new drivers or any of that painful nonsense. I just started up my computer and the new hard drive was good to go and oh so fast.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because this drive is much louder than my old one as far as the spinning is concerned. Granted it's a 7200rpm as opposed to the 5000rpm of the old one, but I can hear this thing whirring like a jet turbine. It's a very high-pitched sound and it's definitely annoying, but I've gotten used to it and I am willing to put up with it for the much larger storage space and speed that this drive provides.",69.95,4.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"December 27, 2012",Great upgrade for my laptop's aging harddrive,Yes,5,5,15

Mann-Filter HU 816 X Metal-Free Oil Filter,4.8,Pri,"Direct replacement for 2006 330XI (N52 engine). Comes with new gaskets for the filter, as well as a new washer for the oil drain plug. Changing the oil yourself is something that will save you thousands of dollars over the life of your Ultimate Driving Machine. Installation is simple, unscrew the oil filter cap, slide the old filter out, slide the new one on, replace the tiny gasket at the bottom as well as the larger gasket towards the top, put the entire thing back and screw it in tightly (I hand tighten it to make it easier to remove next time). I try to change my oil between 10,000 and 15,000 even if the vehicle doesn't tell me I need it, but I'm going to start replacing the filter more often than that because it's cheap and I'm a bit of an ""enthusiast"" when it comes to my driving style :) To reset the oil service light, just search Youtube (example: E90 service reset), there are literally hundreds of videos showing how to do it.<br/><br/>Update: If you can, use a torque wrench and adapter to tighten the filter housing. The last time I hand-tightened, it wasn't enough and the high pressure caused the gasket to flare out, and oil to spray all over the inside of the engine compartment.",11.20,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"June 23, 2012",Can't ask for more,Yes,4,3,13
"""BMW Genuine Cup Holder for Left / Driver Side, Black Color, 3 Series (From 2005 - Present)""",4.8,Pri,"I bought this to swap out the broken driver's cup holder in my 2006 330XI. The installation is really straight-forward and simple and only took about 7 minutes. All you do is remove the plastic trim that surrounds both cupholders, it's held in place with several plastic clips that just pop in and out of place, then unscrew the two screws that hold the cupholder in place and slide the entire thing out, replace and reverse the steps. I will eventually buy the passenger's side one too since they don't match now, the new one has a little chrome accent piece on it that my originals do not (I like the look of the new one better). This is much cheaper than buying from the BMW dealership, and it saves you close to $100 to install it yourself. If you have any installation questions, I'll try to help you out, just leave a comment on here, I'm not any sort of auto expert or anything, just like to get my hands dirty.",50.53,5.0,A35YEABW3T8OP4,"June 23, 2012",Perfect replacement,Yes,7,7,12

You would think that it should remember that as well so you can get on and immediately start the same workout each time - not so.<br/><br/>I use it every other day and simply start it in manual mode, then push the resistance setting, then a minute or two later, lower it, then raise it, then lower it - you get the idea.",278.99,3.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"November 4, 2015",Decent quality but horrible interface.,Yes,,,89

Now that I've figured it out, it's a decent player for $10, however I have a great deal of time invested in figuring it out (same buttons do different things in different modes).  The time invested far exceeds the value of the player.  Now that I have it, I'll keep it since returning it goes to China.  You supply the memory (micro usb), but has a nice color screen.<br/><br/>Four buttons on top.  A ""+"" (up) an ""m"" (enter), an ""-"" (down).

I've fired hundreds of rounds of 300 blackout at it around 25 yards expecting it to have a short life.  It has done nothing but take the paint off.  The only reason I gave it three stars is the three holes.  I understand the reasoning in that it's either used as a gong or on a hanger.

In either case, I want to catch as much brass as possible and this does a perfect job.

In reading some of the reviews, I'm baffled because I've found them to work flawlessly and have never had an issue using the combination.  The first was kept with the one it came with and the second and third were changed to match the first for consistency reasons.  That  presented no problem at all; I just make sure to push on the shackle before opening.  The only other thing I've done that you aren't supposed to do is put a bit of WD 40 on them if they seem to want to bind.  All are used outdoors in Iowa so they are definitely exposed to the elements.

It's much larger on the wrist than I anticipated, but that is subjective and obviously ok with everyone else.  I'm a fairly big guy and it feels like a I have clock on my wrist.  The other thing is that when I took it to the Jeweler to have two links taken out, he commented that people either love them or hate them (being eco-drive).  I asked what problem people had and he stated that while it doesn't ever need a battery, it will at some point need a capacitor.  He commented that if you give it a good full charge with daylight every month, it could be much longer before that is necessary, but he has replaced many at seven years.  He said $65 is about what it costs to get one and have it put in by him, but that the capacitor is more expensive from Citizen.

Amazon Fire TV Stick,4.2,DJ,"It's a great solution and very straight forward to operate.  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars is that Netflix is an application like any other and now and then, you need to re-enter your user name and password.  Makes sense I guess since it's the ""competition"", but in general, it was well worth the $20 I paid when introduced.  Even at the current price, it's well worth it.  It was easy to pair my laptop and phone and like the fact that you can send any youtube video from your laptop to your TV and that your phone can be a remote with voice.<br/><br/>I was also pleasantly surprised that you can operate it easily with the remote even though the stick is behind your TV.  The remote navigation is a bit tricky to get the hang of, but you get it fairly quickly.  It was also easy to ""pair"" my phone with it so that it too can operate as a remote.

It was easy to assemble and took no more than a few minutes.  Initially I was pretty unhappy as simply shifting weight between legs made a vast difference and it was very difficult to center.  After discovering a large ""S"" hook that was extra, I determined after a little inspection that it was part of the mechanism.  Not sure how it could have come off, but it obviously did.

Global Sportsman Tactical Combat Military Four 4 Separate Reticle 7 Brightness Settings Red Dot Tubeless Open Reflex Design Sight with Weaver-Picatinny Rail Base Mount,4,DJ,"Works very well for a very reasonable price.  I put it on a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P22.;  It was easy to dial in with a great deal of range and coupled with a set of 45 degree offset iron sights, it's a great combination.  On a more substantial rifle, I""d set it for longer distance and the offset sights for close, and you would have a cost effective viable sight system all the way around.<br/><br/>That said, I've found that once dialed in, you should not change the reticle display.  I've tried twice with the same result of losing the point of aim by a substantial amount.  It is necessary to re-zero it.

Lee Precision 300 Aac Blackout Very Limited Production 3-Die,4.7,DJ,"Like all my other Lee dies, they are durable, have a near unbreakable primer pin punch and a good value.  I still use my first set of 38 special that I bought in 1985.  The proper shell holder and loading data comes with.  If you don't have other equipment, you can also use the included dipper with the included data to create safe and good loads.  With a small amount of care, (simply don't let them rust) they will last you a lifetime.<br/><br/>The other thing I like is that Lee and RCBS have the proper head space built in by simply setting the sizer die so that the top of the shell holder meets the bottom of the die.  No guessing.  However, be sure to get some lube on the inside of the case neck so the expander doesn't stretch the case out of spec on the way back out.<br/><br/>That said, 300 blackout cases are commonly formed from .223 or 5.56 cases.  That means that the cases are re-formed, not re-sized.  This set is for sizing.  If you use them to re-form, there is normal ""spring back"" that occurs after the case is formed.  The problem may be that if you have a chamber that is near the minimum SAAMI specs, and the dies don't produce that small of a case after the ""spring back"", it may not chamber.  That is not the fault of the dies - if that occurs, you may need a ""small base"" sizer.  Another option is to send a case that doesn't fit as well as one that does to Lee along with the sizer and they will send it back producing the smaller case.  This applies to 300 Blackout only, all other calibers simply resize cases of the same caliber and there is never a problem.",41.91,4.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"October 10, 2014",Best value in loading dies.,Yes,3,2,66

A Traditional Tool Chest in Two Days,4,DJ,"I'll be the first to admit that even though I admire Chris Schwarz, I have difficulty watching him do an instructional video.  He even admits that he leaves something to be desired in this venue.  I buy them, because he knows his craft and the information is good.  However, for me, it takes a little sweat equity to watch them all the way through, but I can't and won't deny that the end result is positive.  The plans, cut list and purchase items are included on the DVD<br/><br/>As to the chest itself. It's the original design and size, being very solid using butt joints and screws. Since plywood has no movement, It will remain a very stable chest for as long as you and whomever you leave it to can use it.  Even though I'm proficient at dovetails for the original chest, that and planning panels flat just isn't something I want to invest five days doing for what appears to be little or no gain. It must be a pride thing.<br/><br/>Four instead of five stars because the video has a great deal of filler with other chests and designs, and the fact that he uses one drill and keeps changing the drill and screw bit back and forth instead of using two for expediency.  That process gets old quickly and I thought he would have been better prepared for a video shoot.<br/><br/>I've now built the chest and am vey happy with it.  The order of operations and the manner of build helped me get it done efficiently and quickly.  The only thing I did differently is apply the lid skirt after the lid was on. I just fitted it, then planed it flush. No worry about scraping the veneer on the plywood a little as it gets painted anyway. It worked great for a perfect fit all the way around and was much easier and faster than how he does it with the lid removed.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about the Anarchist chest, consider this because of it's strength and stability.

For that purpose, it works great and generated some interest from students.<br/><br/>I did mess with them enough to see how they worked and it's interesting in that the key is threaded and goes into the threads of the cuff.  When it places enough pressure, it releases the part of the cuff that goes through it.

With those, I always seemed to manage to hit the mode button or lap button and have to screw around to get it zero'd and ready to go again.<br/><br/>While this one will work just the way I want, what I found lacking is that the button to start and stop it is not very smooth (or at least on mine).  I have to push it with different pressure many times to get it to activate.  On the upside, just a few turns of the winder puts enough tension on it for a very long time - there is just no need to wind it anywhere near it's capacity.

Irish Legends For Children,3.8,DJ,"I have been looking for a good children's book of Irish short stories.  Primarily, I was looking for the story of Tir na nog (Tear nah noag) as it's a wonderful tale that includes a magical land, a princess, a horse that gallops over water, aging, love and a life threatening rule.  This book includes that story, a few others that are equally as good.  It has decent but not fantastic pictures. Beware though, most Irish stories have very sad endings and many times deal with death.<br/><br/>The only other thing that tends to be a challenge is pronunciation of Irish names.  I spent a short time living in Ireland which exposed me to these great stories, but I needed help from an Irish speaking friend for almost all of them.  I'll make an attempt but can't guarantee absolute accuracy.  In no particular order, the various names in the book are:<br/><br/>Ainle  (On-Lay)<br/>Aodh  (Aid-a)<br/>Aoife  (Ee-fah)<br/>Caomhog  (Qui-voag)<br/>Con  (Kahn)<br/>Connacht  (Con-ect)  (Area of Ireland)<br/>CuCulann  (O'Cullen)<br/>Culann  (Cullen)<br/>Cumhall  (Ke-mall)<br/>Deirdre  (Deer-drah)<br/>Feildhlim  (Phil-oave)<br/>Fiachra  (Fee-kra)<br/>Fianna  (Fee-en-a)<br/>Finneigeas  (Fin-eh-gee-es)<br/>Fionn  (Fe-en)<br/>Fionnuala  (Fin-oo-lah)<br/>Gleann na Smol  (Glen nah smoal)  (Dead End)<br/>Goll Mac Morna  (Goal McNamara)<br/>Leabharcham  (Laura cham)<br/>Loch Lein  (Lock Lein) (Large body of water)<br/>Maeve  (Maive)<br/>Naoise  (Noise)<br/>Niamh  (Nee-ev or Neeve)<br/>Oisen  (Ocean or Oy-shin)<br/>Samhain  (Shiv-ahn)<br/>Setanta  (Se-tanta)<br/>Sliabh  (Shliv-mish)<br/>Sliotar  (Slit-th-er)  (Ball)<br/>Tir na n-og  (Tear-na-noag) (Mystical Place)<br/>Uisneach  (Ush-knock)  (House)",17.60,5.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"April 23, 2013","Finally, a great book of short Irish children's stories",Yes,4,3,56

HD 720P 2.5-inch LCD Monitor CAR Dash Dashboard CAMERA Cam VEHICLE VIDEO Accident RECORDER DVR Support SD/MMC Memory Card : Up to 64GB,3,DJ,"After reading several reviews, I settled on this one figuring that if it didn't work out, I was only out a few bucks.  My initial complaint is that screw portion of the mount was not long enough to enter the hole in the camera if you kept the locking ring on it.  Therefore, I initially just screwed it into the hole without the lock ring and it worked, but later just just modified the lock ring by making it thinner (used a mill file) and it works fine.<br/><br/>I write the review because I read so many that said the unit stopped, wouldn't start when it was supposed to, etc.  I'm fortunate that mine works as advertised.  No, it's not clear enough to read plates unless you are close, but you can certainly see a wide angle around you, intersections, stop light colors and other detail.  Night is less detailed but that's not surprising.  You may not be able to provide a licence number in an event, but you can certainly show what occured to interested parties in plenty of detail and a great description of any other vehicle involved.<br/><br/>I've learned the following after playing with it.  Shut the sound off; it doesn't legally provide anything and no chance to be heard should you say something you would regret.  Select standard VGA at 640x480 even though it can be set to higher resoultions - however, the others are interpreted by software and are simply close ups and really less clear because the software fills in pixels that are not actually there.  I select 5 minute cycles so if I need to show a video in court for some reason, the full video only contains 5 minutes maximum - less driving for others to critique.  When a 5 minute segment ends, the next starts immediately with only a second or two max delay between them  So far, mine has started and stopped without fail.  Lastly, use both the date and time stamp.  Nice to zero in to show what happened at that time instead of just the date.<br/><br/>So far, its performed better than I expected.  It uses a standard SD card which is easy to get to as it's in the back of the unit.  The bigger the SD card, the more driving history is saved before the first gets written over.  To view, simply place the SD card in your computer and click on the files which will automatically play on the standard media player in your operating system.

Stanley 69-189 Ratcheting Multi-Bit Screwdriver,4.5,DJ,"The last thing I needed was another magnetic screwdriver.  I ordered this one because of the locking collar and I'm actually surprised there aren't more to choose from out there.  It works much like how an impact driver works as it relates to how bits are changed.  The only difference is that this screwdriver moves forward to release and insert the bit as opposed to back.  Makes no difference at all as to function - works perfect.<br/><br/>Why four stars instead of five? - well, in my opinion the handle is a little on the large size and the ratchet setting moves a lilttle too easily between forward, backward and stationary.  There also isn't much circumfrence distance for the settings in that it doesn't even move a quarter way around to cover all three settings.  My personal preference is to leave it set as a standard screwdriver, but I will say the ratchet does what its supposed to.<br/><br/>Another company sells the same type of screwdriver but with a nice wooden handle - no where to keep extra bits, but it is nice.

Bahco 5-Inch 474-125-0.80 Cabinet Scraper,4.2,DJ," Length:: 3:31 Mins<br/><br/></span>I have had several scrapers over a period of a few years, but have found the Bahco's to be by far the best.  They seem to retain a burr the longest and is no harder to get one put on.<br/><br/>There seems to as many ways to sharpen a scraper as there are people that own them.  I'm showing a video of my way which takes just a minute.  While a more lengthy way might be better, this way certainly works well, and lasts a very long time.  I use this because I'm of the opinion that if sharpening something takes just a minute or so, you'll do as often as you should unstead of trying to work with a dull tool.<br/><br/>These scrapers when used in conjunction with a hand plane almost eliminate the need to anything but the finest sandpaper.  I use scrapers mostly for tough grain that would normally tear out or with removing an area of finish of which glue residue has remained.  It's a very useful tool and I wouldn't be without them.<br/><br/>Edit as of 3/25/2015:  It's been pointed out that I left out the fact that I used a ""Kuze"" tri-burnisher.  Even though I've used a round one, I find that an ""edge"" helps roll the burr quicker and more efficiently.  If I didn't own that burnisher, I'd use the back edge of a chisel, just be sure to put a bit of lube on it.",17.71,5.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"February 26, 2013",Learn to sharpen and you'll rarely use sandpaper again.,Yes,1,1,52
Porcelain Broiler Pan with Chrome Grill,4.2,DJ,"I ordered this prior to reading the reviews for some dumb reason.  Once I did, I had some buyers remorse but it was too late to cancel the order.  When it arrived, my wife seemed to like the chrome grill portion so we decided to keep it.  Within a day or two, she put some steaks on it (too cold outside) and it did fine as you would expect any broiler to do.<br/><br/>Later, she cleaned it up and said she didn't really need to put it in the dishwasher because it cleaned up so well.  She put it in anyway and when it came out - it looked as well as when it came from the box.  Two or three more uses yielded the same results.  For use, she put foil in the bottom the first time and then a little water instead with subsequent uses and it cleaned with the same ease.  Really can't ask more of an inexpensive broiler but give it four out of five stars because it works as it should, but doesn't stand out as perfection.",16.99,4.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"February 23, 2013",Pleasantly surprised,Yes,1,1,51
Osborne Table Saw Miter Guide EB-3,4,DJ,"I've had the EB3 for nearly 10 years.  Having read the the other reviews, I'm trying to be objective but can't really understand why one would need a sacrifical fence for any operation.  The gauge works with either a right or left tilt saw but mine came set for left and I've never had occasion to change it.<br/><br/>I spent the time when it arrived to get the eccentric nut turned so that it was exactly 90 degrees to my blade and haven't changed it since and it has held all this time.  There are only four tension knobs with two enabling the entire face to move away or toward the blade.  The other two simply allow the extension bar to move in and out.  Extended, this gauge allows a 42"" crosscut.  The sandpaper that comes with is course and allows a great grip for your piece on the face.  Additionally, the stop easily swings upward and downward - this is very handy because I swing it up and run one edge through, then lower it and place the fresh edge against it for the final cut to size. The result negates the use for a radial arm or chop saw except for rough cutting to width.  It's also very easy to replicate an angle because there are detents in the adjustment allowing you to return exactly where you need.<br/><br/>In my woodworking club, members have different brands and all have nearly the same features.  However, more than one has said they wish they would have bought the EB3 due to it's larger protractor type construction, its ease of use and adjustment.

Adequate, but no where near hi-res, even when set at the higher rate.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>The unit is handy and portable enough that I don't regret the purchase, but I think it's a more specialty item geared to photos.

Genie GK-R Intellicode2 Wireless Keypad,4.4,DJ,"Frankly, I was ready to send this back.  I found the instructions very lacking as the keypad simply didn't respond as they said it should.  This resulted in an internet (Genie) and youtube search which yeilded different directions yet.  Still, it did not work following them to the ""T"".<br/><br/>As others have said, it comes set for Intellicode 2 which are very new openers.  I suspect most people need inellicode 1 as I did.  Following the directions, the unit would not move from intellicode 2 to 1, or take a PIN because the unit did not come ""cleared"" for use.  Finally in complete frustration, I called the Genie help line in which the directions had a typo that couldn't work as it didn't have enough digits.  Fortunately, the number is on the lid of the keypad.  I waited a on hold about 15 minutes, (hard to belive that many people need help) but finally got through and a nice woman told me how to clear the keypad which was not on any directions or youtube video.<br/><br/>She had me hold the ""Program"" button and the ""Up/down"" button at the same time for five seconds and could immediately see that worked.  To program the PIN, press 3-5-7 and press ""Program"", then enter your PIN and press ""Program"" again.  Close the cover and wait for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>To change from Intellicode 2 to 1, enter your PIN and press the ""Up/Down"" button and then hold the ""Program"" button until it turns red, then close the cover again.  I followed the normal directions for syncing it to the opener and it worked right away.  In short, if the unit came ready to program, or the directions would have been right, the call wouldn't have been necessary.<br/><br/>My three stars reflects my overall experience of time invested and frustration with directions that were not accurate and a unit that came that was not ""cleared"" for use.  However, once I was squared away by tech support, I give the product itself five stars as it works perfectly subsequent to that.  If Genie's directions would have covered these steps correctly, it would have been a pleasant experience all the way through.",19.32,3.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"December 1, 2012",Initial frustration - ends in useful product,Yes,6,6,47
Shop Fox W1668 3/4-HP 13-Inch Bench-Top Drill Press/Spindle Sander,3.6,DJ,"I replaced a floor radial head drill press with this one.  Since I rarely (one time) needed the versatility of a floor model, the bench model seemed more to my style.<br/><br/>Earlier in the year, I purchased a Shop Fox sanding station which I reviewed here.  I was very happy with that purchase with only finish being a negative.<br/><br/>If you compare this model to a Powermatic, you'll be dissapointed, but I'm very happy with it.  It's got more than enough power for me at 3/4 HP and I've found the table to be very easy to adjust (not so on the previous press).  It does support more speeds than I need, but normally leave it set at one for woodworking anyway.  I'm familiar with the depth adjustment system as my previous one was Grizzly and these two companies are joined at the hip.<br/><br/>I didn't buy it for the oscilating feature, but I give kudos to the deisgn engineer.  It works perfectly well, but as other reviewers have said, it's not a sander to use great pressure against.  It also takes a little set up to get the drums assembled for use.  A nice feature is that there is a cutout in the table for the largest drum and spacers to take up room for the smaller ones. It also contains a dust collecting feature which works better than I thought it would.<br/><br/>So far, I've used this for wood and metal and am happy with it.  Again, it's not a Powermatic but I didn't pay that price either.  The finish is typical roughness of Shop Fox, but in operation, it works as well and accurately as ""higher"" quality machines I've used.

KREG KMA3200 Shelf Pin Drilling Jig,4.7,DJ,"I have been a big fan of Kregs pocket hole technology for many years.  For some aspects of woodworking, it's been the best thing since they put pockets on shirts.  I'll admit that I've made some ""quick"" pieces of furniture with that jig that are still holding up today as the day they were built.<br/><br/>Since that time, Kreg has come out with many new products. I have a couple, but frankly, none in my opinion met the same level of innovation and handiness as their pocket hole jigs, until now.<br/><br/>I've used other shelf pin jigs, but found them either bulky, more complicated, or required a router.  With this jig, the bit and registration pin fit neatly into the back of it when not in use which allows the whole thing to fit in a small drawer with nothing else to locate for use (except the drill).  It also sports the same lifetime drill guides we are all familiar with.  Some argue that it's too short, but in reality, how many holes does one need for any one shelf?  Even if you do, it's very easy and fast to extend the line using the included registration pin.<br/><br/>Additionally, the registration ""shelf"" can be fitted to either edge allowing two different configurations of where holes will appear. It can also be used without the registration ""shelf"" in the case of the back of an already existing cabinet. It's very versatile for such a compact jig and I don't see buying any others looking for the right one.<br/><br/>I'm glad to report that after using this a few times, it takes me right back to the pocket hole jig in terms of quality, innovation, ease of use and accuracy.

I reference his two books often and they have given me several ideas and educated me to the point that it has certainly enhanced my woodworking experience.<br/><br/>If there is any downside, it's simply that he uses some very old techniques of hand tool woodworking and while informative, some seem to be quite outdated.

It's the best marking knife I've ever used and am dissapointed that I have so much time and money in trying to find others that don't work nearly as well.  The blades are stout enough, sharp and able to get in very tight areas.  I use it for all hand tool tasks such marking out small hinge mortises, creating knife walls for dados, dovetails, etc.<br/><br/>Mr. Sellers says that he uses a blade (keeping it sharp) for two years before chaning it and he works wood every day, several hours a day.

DMT WAV-F Diamond Wave Fine Sharpener,4.4,DJ,"This sharpener was purchased so that it could more easily sharpen beading blades from combination blades.  What I found was that there is very little area that the radius of your blade matches the tool.  Obviously, this is so that a fairly short sharpener will accomodate from the largest to the smallest of blades/tools.  While it makes sense on paper, it doesn't allow much room to work the tool before you are no longer in the radius that you need.  I've since adapted a better system.<br/><br/>That said, I use DMT products (stones) to sharpen both plane irons and chisels and have been very happy with them for a very long time.  I'll continue to buy DMT, but this one just didn't match the hype in my opinion.<br/><br/>Edit as of 12-12-12:  I've learned a little trick that makes this product more useful than originally thought.  Instead of trying to hone the bevel of a beading blade, I now flatten the back on a stone, turn it over and remove the slight burr of the bevel side on this product as though it were a simple slip stone.  This makes it much easier, faster, greatly extends the life of the bevel and the iron is just as sharp.",59.99,3.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"May 13, 2012","Quality is there, but doesn't meet the hype",Yes,8,8,42
Stanley 12-951 SpokeShave with Flat Base,4.3,DJ,"I bought this a first spokeshave and got what I thought were pretty decent results.  Sharpening the blade and flattening the sole made a tremendous difference between receiving it and what it does now, even though it worked better than I expected out of the package.<br/><br/>Still not being sure what a proper shave is supposed to feel like, I did purchase a low angle Veritas.  Granted, that shave works incredibly well, but frankly, I still use the Stanley a great deal and intend to keep doing so.  It adjusts far easier than I expected and the cap iron actually has a good fit to the blade.  Having both allows me a dedicated tool for both rough and fine work.<br/><br/>In short, this was a very good purchase and it certainly performs better than you would expect any $20 tool to work.<br/><br/>Edit as of Jan, 2013:  I've used this for awhile now and can't really justify buying a more expensive ""premium"" one as it works perfectly well.  Since having this shave - I no longer use a spindle sander for any gradual curve.  This not only does it better, but in a fraction of the time.  I simply draw the curve, stay outside the line on the bandsaw and use the shave to go to the line and the result is a far smoother surface than if I had used a sander.

"Eclipse EWWQR10-NA Quick Release Woodworking Vice, Gray Cast Iron, 10"" Size",4.6,DJ,"I've only had this a very short time and installed it, but my friend has one of which I've used extensively.  Because of the quaility and ease of use, I pitched my leg vise and bought one of these.<br/><br/>This thing is a beast and has an opening that exceeds any drawer width you could possibly use it for.  The quick action lever works very well and the turn screw and opening /closing hardware are substantial.  It has a place for four bolts or lag screws and two holes on the back plate to put screws into the benchtop.  I recommend using all due to it's weight.  Mine is very solid and even with two 3/4"" chops of hickory, it still opens to a little over 13"".<br/><br/>As I understand it, this company bought the tooling from Record so it's the closest you'll get to the old Record style vise. One last point - get a friend to help you with installation and if possible, turn the bench on it's side so gravity works for you instead of against.  It could very well prevent a hernia trying to muscle this thing into place.<br/><br/>Update as of 12-12: Having used it for awhile now, I can say that I'm upset only at the fact that I didn't put one of these on years ago.  While I admit to missing the depth of a leg vise, I don't miss not having to set a parallel guide and this is so much more strong that depth can still be achieved by setting the board in one of the sides because it doesn't rack.",114.53,5.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"April 7, 2012",It's a beast,Yes,7,7,40
Shop Fox W1676 6-Inch by 10-Inch Combination Sander,4.3,DJ,"Had been saving for a Jet, but another reviewer thankfully pointed out that the cover for the radius couldn't be removed and pointed to the Shop Fox as the alternative of his choice.  This is important as I use it a great deal.<br/><br/>The sander is heavy duty and the stand provides a stable base, ample storage and a small footprint.  It assembled well, instructions were decent and it was running in a short time.  This Shop Fox adjusts easily and has plenty of power - haven't seen a hint of bogging down yet.  I also didn't really think that the extra inch in the disc sander (10"") from the norm (9"") would be noticeable, but it is, and appreciated.  The tracking is something I figured would take awhile and counted on it.  However, it took no longer than to turn the knob and steer the belt to the center of which it stayed under heavy sanding.  I also appreciate the tension release which will make it a snap to change belts, especially since I don't have to remove a radius guide, unless I want it there.<br/><br/>If there is anything to complain about, it is that it sits a little high for my taste, but I'll get used to that.  The other thing is that is not as quiet as my previous sander.  Obviously something I'll learn to live with, but was a little surprised by it.  Guess it's the comprimise for the power.<br/><br/>My friend has a Jet and it is certainly a nice sanding station with a bit better fit and finish, but I'm not dissapointed in this and would make the same decision if I had it to do over.",563.44,4.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"February 6, 2012",Very pleasantly surprised,Yes,7,7,39
Sanyo HPS-SG2 Indoor Barbeque Grill with 120-Square-Inch Nonstick Cooking Surface,4.3,DJ,"I really couldn't convince myself that a $34 indoor grill would really do what I wanted and needed, but for that kind of money, I had to give it a try.<br/><br/>The grill has exceeded my expectations.  It's not totally smokeless but still very good.  It is the right size for two people, it cleans up easily and it warmes up quickly.  I'm also amazed at how moist the food stays.<br/><br/>I read the reviews - and took particular interest in the experience of a couple about cooking and cleaning this product.  They spoke of two things.  First, was putting a cookie sheet or something similar over the top but doesn't touch the plastic so it won't melt.  The other is actually in the book regarding using water in the drip plan and to spray a little Pam or something on the grill surface.  Lastly, when the food is removed, I took reviewer advise and put wet paper towels on the surface, then clean it when you're done eating.  It worked like a champ. I can now see that a good heavy sponge will go along way to getting all parts of the grill surface without comprimising the teflon.  Get it when it's moist and it's very easy.<br/><br/>I'm very happy with this and wish I'd have found it years ago.  I want to extend my gratitude to the people that posted reviews.

Jorgensen 60115 Pony Tools Miter Box with Saw,3,DJ,"I split the difference between 1 and 5.  As it comes, if you expect it to give you a finished product off the saw then 1(or less) is the proper rating.  If you use it in conjuction with a shooting board with a hand plane, then it does exactly what you expect it to do.  I could have made one, but this was cheap enough, it wasn't worth the effort.<br/><br/>For me, I simply cut to my angle knowing it's only close.  When done, I put the edge on my shooting board and give a few swipes with the hand plane and then a I have an absolute perfect 90 or 45 degree angle with a smooth as glass edge.  Granted, it's the shooting board that does that, but the cheap miter box makes quick work of getting something close enough for the shooting board in very little time.

Staedtler Double-hole Tub Pencil Sharpener,4.2,DJ,"When I saw all the glowing reviews, I had to try it but going full circle to this type of sharpener didn't make sense to me.  Certainly glad I did - a couple of twists and you have a sharp and very workable point.  It sharpens at a more accute angle so the point isn't so fragile but yet very sharp.  I use pencils allot in my woodshop and keep it in the pencil drawer.  About three twists and I'm back in business.  Saves more time than heading to the wall sharpener that gives a point on one end and a wood point on the other.  This one gives a point every time you would hope to get.<br/><br/>To empty the container - you push in and up at the serrated point, not just in or I think you'll break it.  I haven't used the other hole for colored pencils yet, but I'm sure it works the same.<br/><br/>Time will tell if it holds out because after all, the sharpner itself is the small finger type that was in our pencil holders in school - it's just attached to a more convienient receptical.  It's great for freshining a dull point, but I don't think it's designed to put a point on a new pencil.

Bayou Fitness Total Trainer DLX Home Gym,4.4,DJ,"I'm not sure that I've had it long enough for an adequate review, but have been using every other day for about a month now.  The soreness is gone so I'm hoping the benefits have begun.<br/><br/>Pros:  Heavily built and contrary to other reviews, I have found it easy to fold up and set up.  The press bar and foot board that comes with sits in their holes fairly well but need a little coaxing to get out at the bottom.  I think that time will help with this.  I also find height adjustments far easier than I thought they would be - takes mere seconds so changing from one to another during a routine is not an issue as I thought it might.<br/><br/>Cons:  Nothing really with the machine itself.  Frankly though, even though there are allot of exercises listed, most are just slight variations of a very few basic ones.  It's enough to get a decent workout without having to do the same thing, but the dozens listed is a bit of a stretch (no pun intended).<br/><br/>The only other thing is the attachements for leg workouts - it probably isn't a system most would use as it takes some finess to get it hooked to the ankle right, then to the system (which really can't stay all the time), then getting yourself set properly on the board.  It works, but simply takes too much effort and you lose valuable time.  Therefore, without it, you lose a few of the exercise options in the book.  As a minor thing - one DVD gives a good workout routine and then says at the end ""come back on Wednesday for the cardio workout"" - which does not exist on the DVD.<br/><br/>Overall:  I'm very happy with the purchase so far and have no regrets.  This in combination with a reistance bike is a good all around workout.  I asked my doctor if this would be an adequate system since I've lost allot of capacity of cardio due to a foot problem.  He asked if it got me winded and could keep me winded?  When I advised that it certainly does, he advised that it in turn, it is raising the heart rate and would also serve as an adequate cardio workout.",5.09,4.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"June 28, 2010",Just what I expected,Yes,5,5,35
Bessey SG-8WP SuperGrip 8-Inch Jaw Capacity 2-1/2-Inch Throat Depth Gripping Plier,4.5,DJ,"I've put the purchase of these clamps off due to the price.  I have Bessey Uniclamps and K-Body's and have never had a complaint.  I decided to pull the trigger on these. Yes the money for two of them stings, especially when considering they are simply clamps, but they will last my woodworking time, then probably whoever would get them after that.<br/><br/>They lock incredibily easy in that you simply slide the jaw to the bottom of what you want to clamp and are set to ""cam over"" as vise grips do.  When releasing, the side extended release bar certainly saves your fingers as opposed to the older style of vise grip.<br/><br/>Aug 2010:  They are a stout clamp, but I don't use them enough to warrant the purchase.  Due to the short throat, they are more limited in range than I thought.  I use them for clamping things to the benchtop, but that's about it.  I've also discovered that you have to hold them pretty tight when you close the clamp or it closes fairly loose.  Doesn't matter how good they are if you spend this much money on something that has limited use.  Must confess that I have some buyers remorse due to the cost.

Illustrated Cabinetmaking: How to Design and Construct Furniture That Works (American Woodworker),4.2,DJ,"I have a friend who didn't care for this book due to the lack of actual plans.  However, the vast majority of my woodworking doesn't use them, which is why this book is valuable to me.  The first part goes over every joint or method I can imagine.  It is broken down into carcasses, drawers, runners, wall hung cabinets, tables, etc.  There are great drawings that clearly show how such things are assembled.<br/><br/>The second part of the book has several examples of each type of furniture construction.  If you don't find the furniture piece you want, you can certainly adapt what is there to a different style.  If you are one for plans, there are alternative ideas complete with information as to where the plans are available.<br/><br/>I suspect that this is one of the few books I have that will be well worn and tattered in a short while.",14.47,5.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"March 19, 2010",Surprisingly informative - a great reference,Yes,3,3,33
No. 4 1/2 Smoothing Plane,4.7,DJ,"This is my second Lie Nielsen bench plane - they are certainly expensive and I wouldn't have bought this one unless I was very happy with the first one, and I am.<br/><br/>These planes arrive very well packaged.  When I took this one out of the box, I intially thought it was caught on something - not so, it's simply very heavy.  I immediately took the iron out and honed it which was easy and quick because those thick irons come with a perfectly flat back.  Upon replacing the iron, I tried it on a piece of walnut, both by edge and face.  I discovered that very little down pressure was necessary due to it's 5lb+ heft, just push it along and the result was a full width strip that you could see through.  The blades are A2 steel which takes slightly longer to sharpen (not much) but stays sharp much longer than standard steel.<br/><br/>With knowledgable help, I have fettled a couple other planes to bring them to nearly this level, but it takes more sweat equity than I prefer to invest.  I spring for Lie Nielsen not because I can easily afford them, but because everything is done, the machining is as near perfect as you can get, the sole is flat, the frog is solid and flat and the blade and chipbreaker system is massive. The old Stanley Bedrocks are what the Lie Nielsen bench planes are patterned after, but that is where it stops.  They have greatly improved what is arguably Stanleys greatest line of planes.  They invoke pride of ownership and it allows me to use them with predictable results every time. I can go right to work and I would rather wood work than restore planes.<br/><br/>I'll admit that it hurts to ""write the check"", but the money is forgotten after awhile and you retain the pride of a lifetime quality tool that your kids will most likely fight over when your done using it.",14.47,5.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"March 7, 2010",A pleasure - in all aspects,Yes,3,3,32

I do like the book and really enjoy the first part where he speaks of the handtools he finds most useful and shop aids that have helped him.  (I love the ""shop bents"") It also contains great photos.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how many of the projects I'll try and take on - as an example, I was thinking about the toolbox, but still cannot tell from the drawings how parts of it are supposed to work in conjuction with other parts.  He does beatiful work, I just wish I could more clearly understand his method of operation.

Grizzly H7567 8-1/2-Inch Duplex Rabbet Plane,4.4,DJ,"This fillister rabbet plane, like the Record 778 it is copied for, has a lot going for it.  It has a square iron which is easy to sharpen instead of being skewed like most.  It sports a screw to adjust the iron which is so much more controlable than the lever put on the Stanleys of old.  It's such a close copy that even the little points on the casting that aren't necessary are still there.  It even says ""778"" on it.<br/><br/>The plane did take a little bit of work because the fence was not perfectly perpindicular to the sole of the plane.  This was fixed easily by putting some sandpaper on the side of a board and running the plane on the top of the board.  When I had a scratch pattern that covered the entire inside of the fence, it was done and square.  Didn't take long and worked perfectly - then attached a larger walnut fence to the oringial.<br/><br/>The blade that comes with it is a bit thin but will work.  I recommend getting a Lie-Nielsen replacement iron for the Record 778.  It adds $35 to the overall price but it's a high quality thick blade that will last a lifetime.  It still puts the plane well under $100 total and made a great difference and as to performance and sharpness retention.<br/><br/>There really is no difference between this plane and the orignal 778 - I know because I owned both. When I got the original 778 for a great deal, I eventually sold the Grizzly, but  regret it because it worked every bit as well - just needed that little tweaking.",83.82,4.0,AHMIXQ9CQ1MRY,"January 5, 2010",A perfect copy of the Record 778,,8,7,29
Crown FLINN1 10-Inch Dovetail Saw,4.6,DJ,"A strange review because if I were to rate the saw as it is now, five stars.  The saw as it comes - one or two stars, so I split the difference.<br/><br/>As the saw comes, it has far more of a crosscut tooth pattern and the kerf is too wide.  One of my reviews is on Frank Klausz's handtool video and in it, he teaches how to take a standard gents saw like this and make a fast cutting thin kerf saw with not a whole lot of effort.<br/><br/>Starting with using a hammer to thin the kerf on a small anvil (yes, I said it), the kerf is greatly improved.  I put it in a saw vise and per Klausz, changed the tooth pattern to a rip cut which is what a dovetail saw is supposed to be.  The result is a saw that produces a thin kerf and cuts fast enough that you need to watch yourself or you'll go right past your marking gauge line.<br/><br/>I have a Japanese saw which works well but I prefer Western saws because they cut on the push stroke which keeps your marking gauge line clear to see.  Properly prepared, they also cut faster and almost as thin.  I also have a Veritas dovetail saw which is a very high quality saw, but this is my second Crown gents saw (gave one away) and I reach for it far more than I thought I would.  I showed a friend who was ready to buy an expensive saw and he also purchased the Crown and prepared it using the Klausz method and he is thrilled with it.<br/><br/>In short - as it comes, it's not going to serve you.

I'm amazed at the thin shavings that come out of this little thing - it works better than it has a right to for the size it is.  The choice of bronze wasn't for any other reason than it was only a $20 difference.  I'm sure I'd be just as happy with the iron model, but the bronze is worth some style points.<br/><br/>The blade is a full 1/8"" and only needed to be slightly honed and put to work.  The adjustment is more finite than I thought it would be - you do have to loosen the wheel slightly, and then tighten only an eigth of a turn or so.  Very easy and quick to do.  My only regret is that I didn't buy one of these sooner.<br/><br/>Edit as of May of 2010:  I've been using this awhile now and am amazed at how useful this small plane is.  I've recently made a few items with doors that must have even reveal in the middle and having this little thing in the hand allows me to shave what I need to get great door fits.

I purchased an inexpensive winder and use it every other night - and it's been running for two years straight, and I wear it daily.  It gains about five minutes every three days which I've never tried to adjust and have written that off to the fact it's a mechanical watch.<br/><br/>For me, the band works well after initial adjustment and the watch itself is of great proportions.  What I like most is the ability to see the time with a quick glance.  The contrast of the darker hands to the light face is now a standard for me.<br/><br/>Originally, I bought a different watch but didn't care for it and called ""Just Calculators"".

I put it on the winder every third night and wear it everyday.  The only problem it has given is when I inadvertently let it set too close to a magnet and it ran way fast for a day or so then settled back down again.

Dovetail a Drawer: with Frank Klausz,4.9,DJ,"I have the utmost respect for Frank Klausz. From his portion of a video with the Time Life series, I learned to cut dovetails and with practice have become a little more proficient. Dovetail a Drawer is almost the same as the other video, but what I liked was the little tips such as his measuring techniques that are void of a tape measure in all steps of drawer building. He is also clear about what step comes next up until he does final fitting with a plane. I've made many drawers prior to this and can see I worked too hard on them.<br/><br/>During the introduction when the voiceover is occuring, Frank cuts pins with blinding speed which is obviously for show, but it certainly reminds you that he is one to listen to. All in all, a very good video that encompasses great tips throughout.<br/><br/>Edit: 2/22/08 I have now made several drawers using this method. They are solid, square, fit great and didn't take an inordinate amount of time.  No tape measure was used on any of them.  It is my intent to use the same method for wall hung cabinets.<br/><br/>It does take a little sweat equity in practice, but the result is well worth it.  Frank once said ""Start with four 8 foot boards and start practicing dovetails - by the time you get it down, you'll have a nice little box for your shoe polish"". For me, it took doing one a day for about 30 days and now they are cut much faster (and just as accurate) as pulling out the router.<br/><br/>Edit 12-12:  I've been making Frank's style of drawer long enough now that I don't recall doing it another way.

Even the packaging makes you think you are about to unwrap an arc or something.  As to the the rabbiting plane itself, I chose it to serve both as a block plane and something that has the ability to trim tenons or anything else close to the edge.  After simply putting a slight sharpening bevel on it, it gives me shavings I can nearly read newsprint through.

Grizzly H7566 14-Inch Smoothing Plane,4.8,DJ,"Let me first say that I'm most definately a Lie-Nielsen or Veratis plane fan.  I got this one for Christmas a few years ago and upon first trying it, performed about like I expected which was mediocure.  Since it was a gift, I opted to spend a little time with it.  I was pleased to discover the sole was fairly flat, and the frog was pretty well machined so that saved time.  I flattened the back of the blade, ground it, honed it, put a sharpening bevel on it, touched up the frog and chipbreaker, and set it to close the mouth a bit more.<br/><br/>This is now a favorite.  With the stock blade, it's still technically not quite the performer of a like Lie-Nielsen or Veritas, I would challenge anyone to really see a difference without a micrometer.  It cuts full width shavings resembling strips of cotton. It fits the hand very well and I can get .002 shavings from it without problems but it can get .001 with slight adjustment.  I think that a sharp blade and good fitting chipbreaker are a huge part of the equasion.  It's equivilent in size to a Stanley #5 so it serves me well as a jack plane but even though a tad long, could serve as an excellent smoother. It must be a Wednesday plane because I can't explain any other reason this very inexpensive plane works so well.<br/><br/>Edit as of 12/7/09:  I replaced the stock blade and chipbreaker with a Hock and there has been a great improvement even from an already decent performer. I have a Lie-Nielsen bench plane and a Veritas low angle smoother and both are great planes and are the standards by which others are judged, but this plane with it's modifications does absoultey as well in my opinion.

Coby MPCD471 Portable MP3/CD Player with AM/FM Radio and USB Port (Discontinued by manufacturer),3.2,DJ,"I want to thank Martin for his review which avoided me having to figure out the play method of the unit on USB drives.  The unit works well, has good volume and sound (at least by my ear).  Since the tuning and voulume knobs are in the rear, you have to feel for them, but they work well and it isn't picky about geting a good signal.  I was a little surprised at how small the unit is.<br/><br/>The USB port works well, but the display only tells you which track and how long you are into that track.  At $30, I didn't have a right to expect too much, but was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Edit as of May 2009:<br/><br/>This unit is in my wood shop so I admit the problem I'm now having may be related.  The volume is not working properly.  You choose a volume and later I can hear it go up slightly, then you can't turn it down regardless of moving the volume knob all the way down.  I don't sand much (prefering other methods) so that isn't it and I've tried blowing out the knob with slight air pressure - that too was to no avil.<br/><br/>After a few hours, it will go silent meaning the volume knob is working again.

"NewAir G73 Hardwired Electric Garage Heater, 17060 BTUs, Ivory",3.9,DJ,"I built my woodshop which is well insulated (R19 in walls, R40 in ceiling) and about 460 square feet with 8 foot ceilings.  Living in Iowa, I was skeptical whether this heater could do the job where it sometimes gets 10 to 20 below for several days in Dec and Jan.  Those fears were alleviated.<br/><br/>If you are at all concerned that the heater can handle a level of cold that commonly reaches 33 below (wind chill) and -20 ambient temp, worry no more.  I kept the heater on the third mark out of 10 and it maintained between 49 and 53 depending on the coldness of the night.  When I went out to work, I turned it up to a tad beyond LOW and it leveled at 60 degrees.  It's also very quiet in that I'm able to have a normal voice conversation with anyone present and we aren't really aware when it turns on.  Very nice not have the smell of fuel oil in the air.  I'm very happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>As to cost - I'm lucky because through the use of a heat pump in the house, I use over 1000k and with my electric company, anything over that is just 2.5 cents a kwh.  That makes heating the shop very affordable for me, but without that break, it would be quite a bit more expensive.<br/><br/>Edit as of 01-03-09.  The local news just advised that here in my area, it is the 9th coldest December since 1897 when they started keeping track.  They also said it is the second snowiest December on record.  There were several days below 0 and a couple to -20 ambient temp which is common in those months any Winter.  This small heater kept up perfectly well.<br/><br/>Edit as of Dec of 2015 - I'm now on my 8th Iowa Winter with this in the shop and haven't had any issue at all.  By this time, I figure it doesn't owe me much, but if by chance it did go south, I'd buy another without hesitation.  Fortunately, it just keeps working as well as the day I hung it.

Bessey UNIK-6S 6-Piece Multi-Purpose Parallel UniKlamp Set,4,DJ,"I have ten of these lighter Bessey clamps in various sizes and use them far more than the multiple other choices in the shop.  Of those, many are the Bessey K-Bodys, but I find they are heavier than needed and as a result, more awkward to use.  The Uniklamps are light, strong and also sport the parallel jaws.<br/><br/>Pros - Light, easy to manipulate and set.  They are strong enough for anything I use clamps for and reach for them first out of several choices.  I made a rack for these placed near the bench because they are used so often.<br/><br/>Con's - Not many, but did discover that over the years, some didn't tighten anymore as the actual clamp portion just slid on the bar instead of grabbing it. However, I discovered that taking some WD-40 on my fingers and wiping it over serrations on the full length of the bar, causes it to engage again as it did when new.<br/><br/>The other thing I do is attempt to prevent placing the clamp bar directly against a glue line as it's difficult to get it off any iron bar clamp.

From him (his DVDs), I've learned to hand cut dovetails, make pefectly fitting drawers without a tape measure and now with this CD, I have learned a great deal about hand tools.<br/><br/>I wasn't really a hand tool guy because I couldn't really get or keep them sharp.  In Frank's direct method that doesn't mince words, he shows and explains how to do it.  As a result, I've used his method and can now get chisels and handplanes sharp enough to push the hair off my arm without spending a great deal of time to do it.  I also really liked his method of saw sharpening and so I bought a cheap one to try it out so that I wouldn't be out anything if I messed it up.  I was able to turn an $18.00 dovetail saw into one that cuts as thinly and effortlessly as my friends saw that cost almost 10 times as much.<br/><br/>In short - he teaches you no-nonsense sharpening of chisels, hand planes and saws.  Then, he gives you easy to understand practice methods of how to effectively use those tools.  I got more out of this CD than I hoped and for less than $20, I picked up some great lifetime skills that have enhanced my woodworking.<br/><br/>Edit as of 11/29/09:  I have a Veritas dovetail saw and I discovered it takes a few more strokes to get through the wood lately.  I finally built the nerve and did Franks sharpening technique on it.

Jet 708569 JWV-9 9-1/2-Inch Woodworking Vise,4,DJ,"I agree with the other reviewer that this vice is not a Record, but it certainly is well built.  Fortunately, I got this vice for $49.00 so based on that, I'm thrilled with it.  I too am dissapointed in the small metal handle but it is sturdy and really, it's only the appearance I don't care for.  The quick release works well and I like the fact that I can adjust and secure the height of the dog.  I've used it now for a few months and do quite a bit of hand tool work to which a good vise is essential.  It will certainly be the tail vise when the new bench is built - It's easily done everything I've asked of it so far.  I'm happy and have no intent to upgrade.<br/><br/>The only downside is that it doesn't have the greatest capacity but a mere 12"" overhang is enough to install it.  I put a 1.75"" chop of Maple on it and along with the backing, I only have about 7.5"" of capacity left.  Since I use it for a tail vise, and have a leg vice, this isn't an issue, but if you need allot of capacity for the opening (over 9""), you might consider one of the Record replicas.  The front mounting holes are also close (about 1/2"") to the front edge of the bench top which made me nervous, but I trusted the design and it's worked fine.<br/><br/>Edit as of June 2012.  I've now used this vise for a few years and work with hand tools a great deal.  It has never let me down and the quick release function still works like the day I got it.  Have no fear, this vise is a heavy, well built piece of equipment that I'm sure will serve you very well.  I've made two workbenches since the purchase and this one remains at the tail - very strong and doesn't rack.

The Original Power Puff (4),5,Charles Seiler,"I can't believe I'm writing a review on a dish sponge. But I'll put it this way. This brush is so well designed and so perfectly sized, and lasts so long, that I acutally sold my dishwasher. I've been doing dishes for 15 years, living alone, and during that time I've hated it. I literally started to enjoy washing dishes after buying the ""Original Power Puff."" I just sold my dishwasher and haven't looked back.<br/><br/>My advice for single men who don't really understand how to do dishes very well (Lol) get a really strong bristle brush with a thick handle, so you can scrub large pans that are very greasy, and then use the Original Power Puff for everything else.<br/><br/>This replaces a scotch bright pad. If you are cleaning stainless steel or steel you don't need steel wool or a scouring pad, just use ""Bar Keepers Friend"" powder (sold here on Amazon too) which is a mild protective acid (DO NOT use Comet or Ajax on metal, it causes rust because it's not an acid, it's a type of salt, and salt rusts metal...) With some ""Bark Keepers Friend"" and this Original Power Puff you clean corroded stainless metal pans and other things made from stainless, and it will look brand new, and won't rust, it will be ridiculously shiny and protected. I am SO relieved that they still sell this foam brush because NONE of the stores carry it.<br/><br/>Washing cups and glasses with this is perfect, because the abrasive scotch bright pad on the end scrubs the sticky goo that hardens in the bottom of cups and glasses. The soft foam or the bristle brushes barely work, and take forever. This thing makes quick work of everything. I also use it on my large pots and pressure cooker, just swirl it around, it scrubs the deposits out of the bottom of pots, and then you're done. Literally the easiest thing I've ever found to do dishes. I do dishes everyday now because it's not stressful anymore. This works a LOT better than a brush, with bristles, because it removes ALL the food off your plates, cups, bowls, pots, pans, etc, without ruining the teflon either in teflon pans.<br/><br/>Highly highly recommended.

Bosch JS365 120-Volt Top-Handle Jigsaw Kit,4.6,Charles Seiler,"I have been wanting a new jigsaw for about 18 years now. I've always owned and used B&amp;D; and Skill brand vintage saws, and recently acquired a rather good quality ball bearing jig saw with a metal case from a junkstore and I thought it would be my last jigsaw purchase! I guess I wrongly assumed that a high quality vintage jigsaw would be adequate. No, I was wrong. I finally grew tired of the almost unbearable vibration of the old vintage jigsaws, all of them had dangerous levels of vibration, even the more expensive ones. I also grew very tired of the tiny stamped steel foot plate on the old saws which always scratches the surface of the wood no matter how careful you are.<br/><br/>Researching saws, this Bosch saw beats out the other saws based mainly on price. But it also has outstanding quality with no inherent flaws like many of the other brands. Here are some things I found when researching saws. Unlike the other reviews which just say ""my husband is happy with it"" I want to explain why this tool is better. People who don't know WHY they like something SHOULD NOT be leaving reviews. Here is an honest assessment based on 20 years of entry level carpentry, inventing mechanical devices, repairing cars and fabricating things.<br/><br/>I happened to go to Lowes to find this saw, because I had a gift card for Lowes. So I am doing this comparison based on the available models at Lowes. I haven't compared the Makita or Milwaukee, but I imagine they are probably just as good. However, the Dewalt jigsaws are not as good.<br/><br/>Pros of the JS365 Bosch:<br/>-Dewalt jigsaws have about 1/16"" play back and forth in the shaft, the Bosch has zero play on the shaft. The other saws in the store have major play in the shaft as well, the Bosch saws had none, including this model.<br/>-The Bosch has a full variable speed trigger, which means you can slow down mid cut, and a speed limiting dial on the back if you want to limit the maximum speed.<br/>-The blade holding mechanism is absolutely great. It locks onto the T shaft so the blades cannot shoot out for no reason, ever. The Dewalt saws, because of patent rights, don't have the same fail safe locking mechanism and the blades don't appear to permanently lock in, but are held in with spring pressure instead (not as good.)<br/>-The foot plate is absolutely solid on this, not even a hair of play at all, no matter how hard you try to move it. It is solid it might as well be welded on. You loosen the allen head screw and the foot plate can be moved, but once tight, it is absolutely rigid. This has always been a major problem on cheaper saws with stamped steel foot plates.<br/>-The Bosch has a cast metal foot plate, which cannot flex. It includes a plastic cover to prevent scratches on fine wood from the metal foot plate.<br/>-The included splinter guard is simply outstanding. You snap it in and even with the most aggressive blade imaginable, the cut is absolutely perfectly smooth, not even a hint of damage to the wood. I cannot believe it. With the splinter guard removed the wood gets torn to bits by the aggressive bits.<br/>-Good dampened vibration, not vibration free, but very acceptable, and no vibration is felt once the saw is pressed against the work piece. Vibration is only really noticeable before starting the cut and it's a medium low level of vibration, but I suspect the Dewalt is smoother based on reviews. This isn't important since the vibration is very minimal in this saw and it won't affect your cutting at all. It's just enough vibration to know that it's a reciprocating saw.<br/>-The speed is out of this world. Cuts are about 20 times faster than the old jigsaw. Just to see if it was the blade, I put the same blades in, and the old 3.5 amp jigsaw cuts about 20 times slower. I cannot figure out why, logically it doesn't make much sense. It has something to do with the longer stroke being more effective, and and the blade pitch being a lot different even on non orbital mode, the new saw makes the old saws I've used feel like unusable paper weights.<br/>-Cheap.<br/>-All metal blade holder.<br/>-Durable saw, built VERY solid. No cheap plastic parts that can break off.<br/>-Blade change is so easy it's silly. Takes 1 second. I can barely comprehend this.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-The blade removal arm that helps make it easier to change blades is plastic, but even if it breaks, it wouldn't affect the operation of the saw and the quick change colar will still work just fine. The plastic lever is really just for added convenience and not a critical part. It's doubtful it would break since there is no pressure on it, you barely have to pull on it for it to hit the collar and release the blade.<br/>-Cheap plastic appearance of saw body. The Dewalt DW331 looks so cool in comparison I almost bought it just because it looked so bad ass.<br/>-The main shaft which goes up and down is very small, and I can imagine that with very aggressive metal cutting or commercial demolition use and abuse of the saw, this shaft could break. In comparison my 1970's saw has the same diameter shaft and only 3.5 amps, not 6.5 amps! One user did report that this shaft broke off. I could not see this shaft breaking off during wood cutting and regular use because the saw cuts through things like butter, and there is basically no load on this round shaft. It would take abuse to fatigue the metal and break it.<br/>-The saw doesn't cut vertical on curves at all with any of the Bosch blades I've tried except the T234X. The T234X blade defies all logic and cuts about 90% more vertical on straight cuts. On curves it works better too.<br/>-The saw won't cut a 90 degree cross cut while using a guide fence, unless I use the scroll blade which is very thin. Use a scroll blade and a guide fence, and the blade won't try to ""wander"" off the cut line because a scroll blade is very thin and goes where you tell it to go, not off in it's own direction. The guide fence will keep the blade going straight. Doing this I got nearly perfect 90 degree cross cuts on 8"" lumber.<br/>-The saw has too much vibration for the Bosch name. My Black and Decker for $45 from 18 years ago was smoother, and had no vibration whatsoever. I'm not sure why the Bosch has any discernible vibration at all considering today's technology of balancing things. I haven't compared this jigsaw to the Dewalt or Makita or Festool, so this could be a very normal amount of vibration. It's very minimal but I would expect in 2016, there would be zero vibration from any given power tool.<br/>-The Bosch brand blades are too soft and deflect about 1/8"" on most curved cuts unless you go slow and twist the saw carefully as you follow your cut. With the right touch you can avoid most of the blade deflection. It's a result of the blades. Some of the blades are far worse than others. The T234X blade seems to have very little blade deflection which I still don't fully understand. It's night and day compared to the ""clean cut"" blade which really produces a horribly deflected cut.<br/>-The blade stays inside the roller wheel and doesn't fall out, but the wheel isn't very right and doesn't do much for keeping the blade deflection at bay. I hear the old Bosch saws were far better in this regard. I heard the Dewalt saw blade falls out of the roller wheel. So the Bosch does have a reliable roller wheel design. Looking at them side by side, the roller wheel on the Bosch saw is deeper and a much better design. Still it doesn't help keep your cuts straight by any means. It barely doesn't anything if you don't cut carefully. If you push hard sideways on the saw you can get up to 1/4"" of blade deflection because the saw blades are all very flexible. Starrett brand has blades which are supposed to be harder and more rigid so they don't deflect as much. Again the T234X blade seems to have the least deflection.<br/>The worst feature of this saw? The case latches. The latches don't work in the cold. You'll need to use a screw driver to pry open the ultra cheap latches which aren't hinged. My Bosch router on the other hand has hinged latches which are VERY VERY nice and easy to open with gloves on. These latches that come on the JS365 case are the worst latches I've ever felt on a case, hence the case is the worst feature of this saw!<br/><br/>All in all I love this saw. For $99 I don't think anything compares. The cast foot plate, plastic foot cover which snaps on easily, and included clear splinter guard which works a miracle on wood, as well as the easy quick release, amazing cutting speed, and good trigger operation make this a keeper. I love this saw. I can't put it down.",16.00,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"December 30, 2015",Best jigsaw for the price period.,,1,1,52

Bosch T234X Progressor Wood Blade (5-Pack),4.7,Charles Seiler,"It doesn't make any sense really, but these blades cut way faster, and with less deflection on the cut, when compared to the ""clean cut"" Bosch blades for wood. These are very aggressive, they practically cut so fast it scares me and I think maybe the wood will be torn to little shreds but when Iook at the wood it's really clean after the cut, no saw marks at all. These blades are the only Bosch blades I've tried so far that give a vertical cut with a zero degree pitch and very close to zero degree vertical cut even with curved cuts on 3/4 plywood. Somehow they also turn very easily too despite being a wider blade, they make turns very easily in the wood without any friction and without much deflection. I haven't tried these without the splinter guard on my Bosch saw so I don't know how clean the cut would be without that, more testing is needed.

Freud D0760X Diablo Ultra Finish Saw Blade ATB 7-1/4-Inch by 60t 5/8-Inch Arbor,4.9,Charles Seiler,"I have heard good things about these blades from a coworker and from just about every wood working video on YouTube. I finally decided to buy into the hype to see if the hype was real. I first compared it to a Dewalt, and the Dewalt did look the same. I bought the Diablo because the name is a legend now, like Bosch jigsaw blades, or Skillsaw circular saws. How could I buy a Dewalt 60 tooth blade for the exact same price of $19.99 when everyone on planet Earth recommends the Diablo brand saw blade?<br/><br/>Replaced the brand new 40 tooth blade that came on my sliding miter saw. It left deep circular blade marks on every single cut, which could have easily been sanded down, but I bought my miter saw for fine finish work, like bird houses, shelves, tool boxes, and house furniture, not rough cut lumber. I notice the Diablo is about 1/16"" in diameter instead of the larger 3/32"" width sawblade that came off my saw. I figured that would help to give the saw more power, since you don't have to remove as much material. My saw only uses a 9.0 amp motor, it is the Kobalt 7 1/4"" sliding miter saw.<br/><br/>This blade really shocked me. The cuts are absolutely flawless, not a single blade mark to be seen on any plywood or pine wood that I cut. It produces no splintering of the wood and cuts just as fast as the 40 tooth blade I removed.<br/><br/>The blade is so sharp, you cannot feel any resistance at all from the wood as you are cutting.<br/><br/>Observation: The blade is so sharp that it grabs the wood and creates vibration while slowing down the 9 amp motor on my saw. The reason for this is an odd phenomena that also occurs with extremely sharp chainsaws. With a brand new chain on a chainsaw, the motor bogs down a lot more if you push the saw at all. With small motors, it seems that sharp blades require a very delicate amount of force when moving through the wood, otherwise vibration occurs and the motor slows down. I am surprised a circular saw blade vibrates and slows down the same way that a chainsaw does when it's extremely sharp.<br/><br/>Overall I love the excessive sharpness, because there is nothing more fun than have EXCESSIVE SHARPNESS. I love it!<br/><br/>I'm still in shock at how sharp this blade is, and how smooth the cuts look.

The energy and feeling of happiness levels out and plateaus and you'll feel enhanced concentration along with a very mild anxiety. This lasts for 4 to 8 hours.<br/><br/>3.) The energy goes away completely if you don't take more NAC, and there is actually a pretty heavy withdrawal. This is just my personal experience, but at the end of the day I felt so tired and so mentally brain dead that the only way to wake up and to function is to consume coffee or take more NAC supplements. This is after only taking 1 500mg capsule at 6:00am in the morning. By 4:00pm, there is a significant mental crash, not unlike a sugar or caffeine crash, but even worse, because the mind also feels clouded.<br/><br/>Notes: These seem to be almost like caffiene, they are very stimulating. However they have similar side effects. If I didn't take them, I would get a headache that was pretty severe, and if I took one of these capsules the headache would go away. These appear to be very addictive to the body. I may be a special case, and this might not happen to anyone else, but I wanted to mention it. Still I would recommend these because stopping them isn't difficult, other than feeling a headache which only lasts one day. However today is day 2 without taking these and my mood is significantly better, I have less anxiety and I feel more physical energy. The anxiety I got from taking these was severe enough that it caused me problems at work and at home interacting with others. If you are getting anxiety while taking these please keep this in mind as a possible side effect.<br/><br/>It might be safer to simply take L-Cysteine which can increase glutathione without crossing the blood brain barrier and causing the mental side effects and anxiety that I experienced. This isn't a bad supplement, and it definitely wasn't a placebo effect in my case.<br/><br/>This is a good supplement overall, and I don't blame the supplement at all for how I responded to it. Many stimulating substances can produce anxiety as a side effect, this isn't abnormal or unexpected. It definitely has an affect on the brain which means you are not getting a placebo when you buy these.",10.15,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"September 6, 2015",Provides Energy with a Healthy Dose of Anxiety - Not a Placebo!,Yes,1,1,45
Lugol's Iodine / 5% Solution / 2 Oz in an Amber Glass Bottle / Free Dropper / USA,4.8,Charles Seiler,"The best type of Iodine for supplementation is iodine mixed with iodide, which is what this solution is. Iodide is used by the thyroid and iodine is used by the organs in the body. Different parts of the body prefer either iodine or iodide, so having a mixture of elemental iodine mixed with potassium iodide is supposed to be better than just taking one or the other separately. This chemical ratio was determined back in 1829, and hasn't changed since, which is pretty astonishing, that's 185+ years ago! This product came very quickly in the mail, was sealed very well, and arrived in good condition.

"Twinlab Men's Ultra Daily Advanced Multi-Vitamin and Mineral Capsules, 144 Count",4.5,Charles Seiler,"Let me preface this review by saying, I've tried other vitamins such as the Alive multi Vitamin and even Blue Bonnet with Iron, and those multi vitamins really killed my stomach. I thought these would be better since I could take 1 tablet, and get a lower dose. The problem is, these also hurt my stomach, about 8 hours after taking them, my system feels incredibly awful, my face burns, my skin and eyes burn, and my digestive system feels ""off"" overall. I also feel a stomach cramp that lasts about 5 hours, and it it just a general cramp in the entire region of my stomach and digestive system, not really a specific part, it just feels like I swallowed something that is too intense, and too strong, and the body is partially rejecting it. I wish these were even smaller, and had an even lower dose. For what it's worth, I wish they would avoid putting all the herbs in these, because if they were just straight essential vitamins, as per Joe Wallach's advice, of having the essential vitamins (he doesn't recommend herbal plants as a daily regimen), I think these would be much better and easier on the stomach. I'm going to guess that part of the stomach pain with these is either because A.) My stomach doesn't like multi-vitamins B.) These have too many unnecessary herbal plants added. C.) One or more of the vitamins are not chemically digestible, due to their chemical formula?<br/><br/>With that said, these are the best vitamins I've found, having the best ingredients list, having REAL vitamin E, from beta carotene instead of the toxic form of Vitamin A called Retinyl or Palmitate derived from animal liver (beware of other cheaper vitamins that have toxic animal derived Vitamin A which is known to cause brittle bones in high doses due to the blocking calcium absorption, also animal Vitamin A is known to be carcinogenic when applied topically to the skin in sunlight. The body can make it's own version of ""animal Vitamin A"" from the Beta Carotene version and this way you avoid getting too much of the animal version. Thank you to another Amazon reviewer who gave me this information, I'm just passing it along.<br/><br/>These vitamins also have all the essential vitamins, which many vitamins do not. Plus they have Lycopene which is supposed to help the prostate in men, by protecting it from free radicals. I know Lycopene has shown many benefits.<br/><br/>These vitamins appear to be really really good, but I'm not sure why they hurt my stomach. I've tried other vitamins and they all hurt my stomach, so don't take this review as a negative. I really think these are great vitamins when compared to 99% of the other vitamins I've looked at, and I've looked at about 60 or 70 of them now, very carefully.<br/><br/>Give these a try!",17.99,4.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"April 20, 2015","Excellent ingredients, Beta Carotene derived Vitamin A, and natural Vitamin E",,,,43
GREAT HUMAN POTENTIAL: Walking in One's Own Light,4.8,Charles Seiler,"I read Bringers of the Dawn by Barbara Marciniak, and that changed my life, as it was channeled information and at the time, I felt like it was speaking directly to me. It changed my entire life. That was 5 1/2 years ago. This book is the only book I've found since that had the same impact. The quality of the content, the clarity of the messages, the practical application of the messages, are priceless. If you are awake, and if you are ready for a big step forward, this is your book. I've heard bits and pieces of this information elsewhere, but not all at once, and never this coherent before. I've also never heard of some of the things they talk about, some of the information is literally brand new, stuff I've never heard of after 8 years of full time research.

"Felo 07157 53167 Ergonic Slotted and Phillips Screwdrivers, Set of 6",4.4,Charles Seiler,"I went out of my way to buy these specifically because they are made from a special metal alloy which is much stronger than 99% of screwdrivers. The Felo, Wiha and Wera, are all very good screwdrivers. However, after 1 day of use, I don't like the gel. I figured the gel handles were going to be amazing, but as it turns out, they are too squishy, and they make you feel less efficient. The very soft and sticky handles really stick to your hand and if you don't have a strong grip, these will help you apply much more torque to a screw. However, personally, I don't like the squishy gel, which really surprises me since I thought it would be really nice. Felo sells red screw drivers, the insulated ones, and they don't have gel, although they look the same. If you do electrical work, the red kit, sold on Amazon here, they come with the tiny 2.5mm flathead which works for terminal blocks.

Well yes, the 1.5mm is the tiniest screwdriver in this kit, it's TINY, of course if you try to crank on it, it's only 1.5mm and it will probably break, it's TINY. I use the 2.0 and the 2.5mm silver colored Wiha screwdrivers and they are the strongest tiny screwdrivers I've ever used.

Makita 5005BA 5-1/2-Inch Circular Saw with Electric Brake,4.3,Charles Seiler,"I own a left drive standard (non worm drive) skillsaw, and it sucks. I have never liked how the blade is setup so you have to cut with you left hand. I also own a Makita 13 amp worm drive saw. This little 5 1/2"" saw does everything the larger saws does, but it does it so much easier.<br/><br/>After cutting with every type of saw imaginable for 17 years, I am sold on the smaller Makita. The build quality, the 8,000 RPM speed, the amazing appearance, it has everything. But best of all, it's easy to use, and you will find that suddenly you can cut EVERYTHING including tiny pieces of 1"" wide slat boards, or things you would normally NEVER think of cutting with a normal size skillsaw.<br/><br/>This saw is my new go to saw for plywood, pine boards and particle board. It has more than enough power because the blade is smaller and therefore it doesn't need as much power, it doesn't bog down at all. The blade stops almost instantly if you remove your finger from the trigger (or you can free wheel the blade gradually to a stop if you don't release your finger all the way from the trigger, which prevents the electronic break from suddenly stopping the blade.) It's a great saw because you can literally replace several saws.<br/><br/>You can replace a hand saw, and you can replace your big overly heavy worm drive saws which can't really do anything better than this (unless you really are cutting super hard, heavy or wet lumber). I love this Makita. They sell all the parts, I had to rebuild mine because a friend sold it to me in rough condition. I ordered all the OEM replacement parts which they still make and now the saw is like new again for about 1/3rd of the price. This is a saw that will change how you use skillsaws.

Nikon D3300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with Auto Focus-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II Zoom Lens (Black),4.7,Charles Seiler,"The Nikon D3300 has some of the best low light and best picture quality of mid level DSLR cameras, in the APS-C sensor size (this is not a full size sensor, but to get a full size sensor you will need to spend about $2000 or $3000 more).<br/><br/>Nikon D3300 is rated 30% higher in image quality compared to the Canon 70D.<br/><br/>The Nikon D3300 has a slightly larger sensor than the Canon 70D.<br/><br/>I was torn between Canon and Nikon. If you look at all the complaints about Canon in the last 1 or 2 years, you will see that they have been going backwards or sideways, while other companies are making huge strides. The Canon 70D is a smooth fast auto-focusing camera that is silent, however if you set it to auto mode and go take pictures they don't look as good as the Nikon D3300 on auto mode.<br/><br/>Comparing pictures side by side with the Canon 70D, the Nikon D3300 has sharper pictures. Zooming in on the photos I took with the 70D yielded a loss of detail. At the same quality settings, same aperture, and shutter speed settings, and with the exact same scene, I am able to zoom in and get better photos from the Nikon D3300, the D3300 really captures crisp photos.<br/><br/>The D3300 may be the only camera that doesn't have image quality problems with the 24 Megapixels. There is a megapixel war going on, although sensor sizes aren't increasing, which means the image quality isn't getting better with many cameras, because they are simply trying to cram more pixels with even less light per pixel, which doesn't help matters. However, the D3300 pulls off the impossible and gets beautiful very sharp photos every time.<br/><br/>The D3300 does very good video, it's glassy smooth and has tremendously good low light video performance, although the focus noise of the lens will intrude on your videos, because you can hear the little motor churning away to maintain focus. You can alternately use manual focus which works just fine for video. Or you can just push the focus button momentarily to get focus and then maintain your distance, and that will allow the lens to stop hunting for focus, which means you won't hear any noise in your video. To eliminate video focus noise you will need an external mic. The auto focus isn't super fast in video mode but it does have video auto focus mode, and if you had an external mic you could do simple documentaries or YouTube clips just fine and have very clean, very smooth video.<br/><br/>For video you could also consider a Sony HX-300 1080 60P, or the HX-400 which has 24P mode too. I've tried the HX-300 and it has nowhere near the low light performance of the Nikon D3300 but it does do really good video and has smooth, fast, silent auto focus, even at up to 50x zoom, which is ridiculous.<br/><br/>The Nikon D3300 takes noise free pictures in any lighting conditions (I haven't tried in total darkness of course). I set it to auto on a black cloudy day, just before rain, and it takes extremely clear pictures with no noise. The same pictures in sunlight were much less sharp, on the Canon 70D. The Canon 70D may be able to match the Nikon if you manually tweak things, but the Nikon doesn't take bad pictures on Auto mode, where as, the Canon 70D on Auto mode takes very average pictures.<br/><br/>I noticed the Canon 70D JPG pictures looked very digitized, and not natural, some were not even usable on auto mode, but the Nikon default JPG pictures look more natural. This is probably caused by better JPG compression on the Nikon? In ""Raw"" shooting mode I'm sure the Canon 70D has nearly equal image quality but I never did try that.<br/><br/>Something to note, the Nikon D3300 does not have a low pass filter on the sensor like most current DSLR's, so in theory it should shoot sharper photos more easily. The purpose of the low pass filter is to slightly blur pixels to prevent artifacts, and moire. The Nikon figured out a way around this, so it can shoot sharper without a ""blur"" filter. Canon people don't seem to care about anything except loyalty to one brand, so good luck explaining this to them! hehe.<br/><br/>This is a very small camera, I would say it feels about 50% smaller than a Canon 70D. It is very light. The buttons are all exceptional. The shutter is very loud as most DSLR cameras probably are. Taking pictures is as easy as turning it on and snapping photos. You'll get amazing results in almost any lighting with this camera.<br/><br/>If you want the best quality pictures, and you want to step up to a professional camera without the professional price, here is the camera you want. Image quality is within 1 point of the Nikon D7100. The entry level Canon DSLR mid-frame cameras cannot match the image quality of the newest Nikons.<br/><br/>Purchase an 18-200mm lens in the future to give you wide angle room shots, or scenic shots at 18mm, or to zoom in, at 200mm. The stock lens works fine, but it doesn't zoom in very far. That is something to consider in your purchase because of the price of lenses. However, this camera will last you for years, and it is a good investment.<br/><br/>Edit: The low light performance of the D3300 is supposed to be very good compared to older Nikon models. I can attest that this is true. In fact, I am shocked at how good the low light performance is. With the use of a tripod, you can turn down the shutter speed so it stays open for several seconds or longer. The picture I took in a non-lighted region of my house looked identical to a normally lit room with bright crisp exposure, and I was able to use ISO 100 setting, there was NO noise. Now this is something you simply cannot do with a point and shoot camera with a smaller sensor. So exciting!<br/><br/>I highly recommend the Nikon D3300 because it does everything very well.",446.95,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"March 17, 2014",Best Picture Quality of Most DSLR's Today,Yes,4,3,34

So far, I am absolutely impressed, as I feel like HP took every idea I have ever had about what makes a good laptop, and they applied it perfect, with perfect execution to build this laptop. It's not only beautiful, but everything is laid out perfectly. Barring sudden hardware failure or a drive failure, I think this is a keeper, and I highly recommend it for any person who cares about quality, speed and aesthetics.<br/><br/>HP 431 G with Windows 7: This laptop is too good, makes other laptops look ridiculous.<br/><br/>[Update: I have been using this for more than 30 days, I've taken it with me out of town, and have tossed it around by accident quite a bit. I haven't had one single problem with it. The keyboard is the best keyboard of any computer keyboard or laptop keyboard I've ever used, it causes absolutely no hand fatigue, which is amazing because typing has always hurt my wrists very bad. It has had no software or hardware glitches of any kind, no system crashes or problems. I've had it in the cold outside in my vehicle for 12 hours, and have really put this laptop through its paces. The hinges are still absolutely solid and smooth, and seem way stronger than most laptops I've seen. The battery life is not 9 hours, it more like 5 hours. It charges up very quickly however.]",9.99,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"February 22, 2014",Superior to every store laptop.,Yes,3,3,31
"Bobble Water Bottle, 18.5 Ounce, Blue",3.7,Charles Seiler,"I am a very picky conniseuer of water. I can't stand most bottled water, especially Dasani (metallic flavored) and any water that has minerals added to it. I have a Pur water pitcher and when you pour terrible tap water through it, the water that comes out is absolutely clean, without any hint of anything.<br/><br/>I just started using the Bobble, and have only drank 1 bottle of water, but I literally cannot tell the difference in taste. I have put it through a very difficult test, I am staying in a place where there is terrible over chlorinated water, and after passing it through the Bobble, the terrible chemical aftertaste is still just as prevalent. There is literally not difference whatsoever.<br/><br/>I have to question the people who have written these reviews. Are consumers being mislead by a pretty bottle? It's a very cool design and the sound is literally not annoying (it's whisper quiet and not even a concern at all...) For those of you who think this water tastes good, are you really a good connoisseur of good clean water?",14.15,1.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"February 18, 2014",No change in taste whatsoever.,Yes,2,0,30
iFrogz IF-CFB-BLK Audio Coda Forte Bluetooth Headphones with Mic - Black,4,Charles Seiler,"Upon putting these on I was skeptical. I had purchased the Sony MDR-10RBT and they Sony have too much bass by default, and have to be tuned down using your music player bass settings/equalizer, which isn't that difficult. However, just based on the stupidity of selling a headphone as well built as the Sony MDR, I expected this no-name brand to follow suite, and make something that sounded just as terrible straight out of the box. I was wrong. These sound INSANELY GOOD.<br/><br/>I have been using an old pair of very very neutral partially open back Sony studio headphones for years, and these iFrogz sound identical with more punchy bass and slightly warmer midrange sounds. However, these headphones have PERFECT midrange, and very neutral bass, not bass heavy, but not light on bass either, they are perfectly neutral. The highs are just average, meaning they aren't ear piercing, or invisible, they are just perfect for average music listening. But most of all, it's the MID RANGE! Right out of the box these have PERFECT mids, and you can listen to rock at FULL VOLUME with zero distortion, and it sounds warm and wonderful.<br/><br/>I am seriously shocked at how good these sound.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>-Twice the battery life of many expensive ones (10 hours)<br/>-Comfotable<br/>-Awesome looks for the price. Ear pieces have sweet logo inside of them and look pretty expensive. Finish is plain but cool looking. -Can be used with cord, without blue tooth.<br/>-Very lightweight, I would never know they were wireless by looking at them, they are that lightweight and compact, literally as light as air and plastic!<br/>-Fit isn't too tight.<br/>-Ear cups feel nice immediately, but will need a little break in.<br/>-Sound perfect somehow, straight out of the box, with Rock, Rap and Country?<br/>-Powerful mid range, moderate clean bass, moderate warm treble (great for ordinary music/movies/talk radio, all day, no ear fatigue).<br/>-They have not cut out even one time while within 5 feet of my USB blue tooth adapter, its only when I leave the room about 15 feet away.<br/>-Don't have any distortion - even at super high volume levels while on Bluetooth. These are LOUD, with DEEP bass and clean. But the bass is neutral - it's not a fake bass sound. If you are picky about too much bass, you will love the neutral sound of these. No bass change is needed straight out of the box, they sound like they were made in the 1990's, and not in the year 2013 when everything has TOO Much bass and muddy sound. These don't have muddy sound. (The corded Bose AE2 I tried had severe distortion at high volume and shrill sounding highs. The Sony MDR-10RBT have way too much bass, but they can be turned down to sound very good.)<br/>-These iFrogz sound better straight out of the box than the Sony MDR-10RBT and corded Bose AE2. Its exciting but disappointing - see below.<br/>-Very open, very natural sound.<br/>-With my Cell phone Bluetooth, sound only cut out once about 15 feet away behind 2 walls, but was otherwise rock solid.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-Bluetooth signal seems to be on the weak side. But only when using small USB Bluetooth adapter.<br/><br/>I walked to my kitchen and they cut out every 20 seconds or so, for a fraction of a second. I am shocked because they sound so good I didn't expect the blue tooth to cut out, but it does. I am using a small Kinivo blue tooth USB adapter, so that could be the culprit. (The Sony MDR-10RBT are ROCK SOLID with their connection, and have 3 connection quality settings to eliminate any possibility of cutting out - they DO NOT cut out, EVER with the 2 lower settings, and only cut out with the highest quality setting on my phone - and never on the USB wireless adapter.<br/><br/>-The iFrogz have no Bluetooth mode settings, which would come in handy for bad connection problems.  Used with my cell phone they appear to be 99% solid and only blipped slightly one time after walking 15 feet away, past 2 different walls, I would feel comfortable using them in 99% of household conditions.<br/><br/>-The ear cups feel nice and soft, and they don't bother me, but they don't swivel side to side, and aren't as large as the Sony MDR or Bose headphones.<br/><br/>-Significantly less battery life than the everlasting Sony MDR-10RBT. However, the iFrogz have ridiculous battery life considering that most Bluetooth stuff is around 3 to 5 hours, and these iFrogz weigh practically nothing, about 1/3 less than the Sony MDR's.<br/><br/>For the price, I can't imagine not having a pair of these. I presently own both the MDR-10RBT Sony, and these iFrog Coda Forte Bluetooth, I am not sure if I should return one or the other, or keep them both. They are both good in their own right, and it's hard to pick a winner. Although the range and quality of the signal on the Sony MDR-10RBT makes them a slight winner.<br/><br/> I had originally purchased a set of Bose AE2 with a cord, and the volume level was so low, and they distortion so high at higher volume levels that I returned them promptly.<br/><br/>*Final conclusion: I had to return these because my ears are just slightly larger than the ear cups. I have very average sized, medium sized male ears, and my ears were about the same size as the inside edge of the ear cups on these. That means the ear cups pressed against my ears around the edges of my ears, which made it hard to position these headphones correctly without getting an annoying ear pain after 20 minutes. The pain is caused by the lack of padding on the ear cups, and the slightly undersized ear cups. If you have very small small ears, these will be more comfortable for you, conversely if you have very large ears, they might be comfortable and cover the outside of your ear perfectly. These sound so good I did not want to return them. I have since purchased some KRK-6400 and they are very clean and crisp, but the iFrogz trump the sound of the 6400 for ordinary music listening, with about 3 times as much bass kick, without having any less midrange. The iFrogz literally are the best, most fun and euphoria inducing headphones I've ever put on, even though they did not have a very sharp treble, they sounded so natural and open, and so powerful, it couldn't help but make me smile with every song (rap didn't sound as great with them, because of the very open sound which doesn't work as well with some rap songs.) Instruments sounded amazing on these, they have to be heard to be believed, although don't expect super detailed or over clear treble, it's not really there, and that's ok for most people because there is no ear fatigue, etc.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you can figure out how to make these slightly more comfortable, or if you don't mind slightly uncomfortable earphones, then you will love these.<br/><br/>I kept my Sony MDR-10RBT and they actually broke in and sound totally different (not as open sounding as the iFrogz, but with a higher quality more detailed sound) and they are so supremely comfortable that I had no choice but to keep them!",14.15,4.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"January 23, 2014","Best quality sound, very comfortable.",Yes,2,0,29
Sony MDR10RBT Bluetooth Wireless Headphones,4.3,Charles Seiler,"[THESE HEADPHONES NEED TO BE BURNED IN AT VERY HIGH VOLUMES WITH BASS SONGS FOR 50 HOURS - OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT HEAR ANY MIDS. ONCE BURNED IN, THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL SOUND: VERY BASS HEAVY, VERY CLEAR AND NORMAL SOUNDING MID RANGE, SOFT CLEAR TREBLE. OVERALL A VERY POWERFUL, FUN SOUND. IF YOU LIKE BASS AND POWERFUL MUSIC, YOU WILL LOVE THESE. THERE IS ZERO DISTORTION EVEN AT EXCEEDINGLY HIGH VOLUME LEVELS.]<br/><br/>I am rewriting my review because I jumped the gun and wrote a review after listening to these straight out of the box. The bass was very heavy and too boomy, and there were no mids at all, so voices sounded like they were in a bucket, half way across the room, and the highs sounded like they were muffled with a blanket. Being somewhat too eager to write a review, I got on Amazon and applauded these headphones without really analyzing them enough.<br/><br/>After writing my review I started noticing they didn't sound that good so I edited my review mentioning the boomy bass. I never noticed the other review saying that you need to burn these in! Stupid me!<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way I accidentally burned these in, after playing them at stratospheric volume levels. I woke up the next morning after putting these headphones through a very aggressive listening session at full volume. I thought I had broke something because they suddenly sounded light, the boomy bass didn't seem to be there. Then I played more music and suddenly realized that I was simply hearing MIDS, which I couldn't hear before. During the last few hours of high volume listening the headphones broke in (burned in).<br/><br/>I just purchased some KRK-6400 headphones which have very neutral sounding mids, and I have tested them against these Sony's. The KRK have an absolutely flat sound and aren't nearly as fun as these MDR-10RBT headphones, but they are very clear and provide a good reference.<br/><br/>With some equalizer settings, to reduce the bass, the Sony MDR-10RBT have astonished me by providing the exact same clear crisp powerful mids as the KRK-6400's. The KRK-6400's are literally totally flat and neutral and have unreal clarity without any EQ changes, however with a small EQ change the Sony MDR-10RBT sound exactly the same, only way, way better, because the KRK-6400's cannot produce anywhere near the same level of Bass.<br/><br/>NOTICE: Regarding Windows Media Player.<br/><br/>If you are only using Windows Media Player, you may not be getting the ideal sound processing, especially if using the equalizer. I downloaded a free music program called Clementine, and with a small change on the EQ setting, these Sony headphones literally have more mids and more sparkle then my old open back Sony studio headphones, but they retain the deep and very clean bass. You will actually be astonished by the sound quality when you adjust the EQ setting. I have no idea why but Media Player in Windows did not work well when I changed the EQ settings, so I would use iTunes or Clementine, or try a different music player, or a different device to experiment while testing these.<br/><br/>I would say that I have at least 30 to 50 hours of listening on them, so I would say at minimum you will need 50 hours of break-in to get the correct sound out of these, and if you don't do that, it will be too early to tell what they are going to sound like.<br/><br/>Now that I've found their true sound, I am VERY impressed with these headphones overall! I would not trade them for anything.<br/><br/>PARTS OF MY ORIGINAL POST AND SOME MORE GENERAL INFORMATION:<br/><br/>I tried some Bose AE2 earlier today and returned them promptly, because they were clear, but all of the music sounded like it was being brought up to a higher pitch, which hurt my ears. Sony has always been smooth, every Sony device I've heard has always had a non-metallic, balanced sound. These MDR10RBT are just as awesome, although I was skeptical at first because of my disappointment with the $150 Bose, which were built extremely well.<br/><br/>I also tried iFrogz (bluetooth), but returned them because their bluetooth cuts out at half the distance of the Sony's and they hurt your ears pretty bad after only a few minutes because of the lack of padding on their cups. The iFrogz sounded amazing, although their engineering wasn't up to par.<br/><br/>These Sony's are the best looking, most comfortable, except for the Bose, out of all the Headphones I looked at in Best Buy (about 25 pair). If you want wireless, these worked right out of the box with my little laptop.<br/><br/>These do not include a dongle, so they really aren't wireless unless you have a bluetooth phone/ipod/lap top etc.. Most all cell phones and ipods have bluetooth, and many Windows 8 laptops have built in bluetooth as well. I purchased a Kinivo 300 USB bluetooth dongle for $15 and it works with these MDR-10RBT at the highest quality settings in Windows 7.<br/><br/>The controls are outstanding. You can actually figure out how to use the controls in a matter of minutes, not fumbling around for days fighting with odd placed buttons or hard to reach controls. You can play music, stop it, advanced it, and turn the volume up and down all using the controls. You simply hold the power button down to reset the bluetooth connection, when you are ready to connect to a new computer/ipod/device.<br/><br/>Range doesn't seem to be an issue. I've walked all around the house with no change in output, no breaks.<br/><br/>These Sony headphones seem more like $350 headphones. Their appearance screams quality, the comfort is outstanding. The very soft head band on top never hurts the top of your head, even if pushing against your head. The side ear pads are very soft and cover the entire ear very easily. I've tried on about 20 pairs of headphones at the store and prefer the KRK-6400 and Sony MDR headphones, which I now own both!<br/><br/>I am returning the KRK-6400's because they sound very neutral and very detailed, but the Sony's can sound exactly the same with a small change in the equalizer setting, and the Sony's have outstanding bass, while the KRK's have none.<br/><br/>Inside the Sony MDR-10RBT's you can see the speakers, overall a very fancy and trick design. The switches, and ports (as others commented) are very nice and refined.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-The standard small stereo jack cord included is about 4 feet long (just barely long enough to sit near a device.) You can order a cloth covered one on Amazon that is 8 feet long for $9.99.<br/><br/>-There is NO blue tooth dongle included, so most likely these won't work wirelessly with your home PC without purchasing a separate $20 universal dongle to plug into a USB port on your computer - they sell these at Staples or Best Buy or Amazon though. (* Some laptops have bluetooth built in, especially Windows 8 laptops). I may not have purchased these if I knew it didn't have a bluetooth dongle, although I don't regret my purchase at all.<br/><br/>-The name Sony isn't highly regarded in this new age of Dr Dre Beats and Skull Candy and other brands which are constantly being shown around in commercials, and on displays. However, I can't believe I gave up on Sony because of their lack of advertising.<br/><br/>Other: It occurred me today that every single Sony item I've ever used has been top notch for the price, and 100% reliable. I have never had a Sony product fail on me, and I've been using Sony products for 20 years. I have never been a fan of Sony, I never made a conscious choice to purchase Sony products in the past, but their price point and features have always made them attractive.<br/><br/>I have an 8 year old pair of Sony MDR-XD200 studio headphones, and they cost $45 at Target 8 years ago. The old Sony headphones sound better than today's new $150 Bose headphones, a LOT better. I was very surprised to say the least. I've decided that I am finally a fan of Sony, it would be illogical not to be. Their price point is spot on, and their durability is second to none. Dollar for dollar, Sony is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>These need to be broke in! They have VERY heavy powerful bass and not a neutral sound, but they have a fun and exciting sound that is especially suited for electronic tones, digital synthesized tones, rap, and slow songs. I am listening to James Taylor now and his voice and guitar sounds are clear and crisp and enjoyable without any EQ changes.<br/><br/>These headphones respond instantly to EQ settings, so just a small change on the EQ gives them exactly the sound you need. It is unreal actually how good these sound, once you turn the bass down slightly. The mids are so well defined, and so clear, songs that I've heard many times actually have a ""brand new"" feeling.<br/><br/>In doing some bass tests with low, low bass, these will play so loud and clear that you would swear you're sitting inside a 15"" ported subwoofer and for a second I even thought maybe my entire body was actually vibrating with bass. The bass has an abstract quality of smile inducing power and texture that cannot be put into words. The bass texture and tone literally makes you smile every time you hear it.<br/><br/>The sony MDR-10RBT bass has a fun sound, although you can't quite define what it is, I attribute this to Sony's signature sound tuning. The bass tone is so gentle and yet so powerful that you could literally listen to nothing but bass tones or bass songs on these headphones all day and never stop smiling. Fortunately the bass is set to a good level after break-in and you can listen to all songs with the EQ totally off and hear the mids really well, with the bass giving every song an extra kick. If you want a neutral sound you will need to turn the bass down of course. Turn down the bass slightly and you get a clean pleasant warm sound with gentle highs. Turn up the EQ and you can bring the highs way up if you want, these respond well to EQ changes.<br/><br/>I have looked at about 20 different bluetooth headphones and nothing compares to these Sony's. They look like $500 or $600 headphones. They have the look, quality, comfort, correct ear cup size, soft ear pads, easy controls, rock solid blue-tooth signal without range problems, plenty of bass, and a very friendly warm sound that is still clear and crisp. This is engineering at its best, something I would not have believed even existed if I didn't buy them.<br/><br/>Battery life is just insane, and these weigh 10 grams less than my old 100% plastic made corded Sony headphones (I weighed them side by side), which somehow seems impossible. You would never know these MDR-10RBT are wireless, they are so light and compact, I have no idea how they did it.<br/><br/>When you shake your head they stay on firmly yet they don't squeeze too tight on your skull, so they would mostly likely work great for light jogging/weightlifting/gym or at work.<br/><br/>Sound with the cord is exactly the same as with the bluetooth at the default level 2 and level 3 bluetooth setting. There is no amp on these headphones so when you are using the 1/8"" stereo cord, and don't want to use bluetooth you don't have to, they sound excellent in wired mode, there is literally no change, except maybe more sparkle to the treble, but I can't personally notice any difference in sound quality.<br/><br/>The bluetooth also has no hiss, although I tested some iFrog bluetooth headphones which sounded excellent, but had a distinct hiss when not being used. The Sony's are SILENT until music plays.<br/><br/>If using Windows, use a program called Clementine, as the sound processing seems to be better than Media Player, although I don't know why, but the equalizer in Clementine changes the sound so precisely that it sounds like you are wearing a different pair of headphones. When you use Windows Media Player, small EQ changes don't sound as natural. iTunes would also be a great alternative, since all Apple products and software are generally very reliable.<br/><br/>These are a marvel of engineering, beautiful to look at, and beautiful to listen to. I am somewhat shocked to own something with such a cool factor :) I can't believe these aren't more popular.",14.15,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"January 18, 2014",Better than Bose. Worth way more than $200!

Seagate 3TB NAS HDD SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive (ST3000VN000),4.5,Charles Seiler,"Good packaging, and arrived very quickly. Boxed inside OEM style cardboard boxes with plastic holders on each end of the hard disk, just like an OEM box. Bought 2, both work perfectly out of the box. On other sites, I noticed these Seagates have the best reviews for entry level NAS/RAID drives.<br/><br/>These drives are absolutely totally silent when idle, you can't hear anything, and you literally can't tell you have 2 of these running in an open computer case, now that's quiet! I will just say, I don't know how they make something this smooth and quiet. Even if you place your hand on top of this drive, you can't feel it spinning.<br/><br/>On reading the hard drives makes some noise while seeking, but overall they are just as quiet as my old Samsung 5400 RPM drive.<br/><br/>My old WD Blue 500GB vibrates so much and is so loud that it seems like a primitive piece of junk in comparison to these Seagate NAS drives, and it's been running fine for 5 years. These Seagate drives are exceptionally refined.<br/><br/>Installed both, no DOA, they work great. I've copied about 500 GB of information and haven't had any issues whatsoever in Raid 1 with an Adaptec 3405 hardware raid card.<br/><br/>This drive is a NAS drive, otherwise known as a raid drive. You need to use NAS drives for all RAID controllers, Raid 0, Raid 1 or Raid 5, etc. Because regular drives don't have a 7 second timeout limit on error recovery, called TLER, ""time limited error recovery.""<br/><br/>Raid drives have a 7 second timeout limit on disk errors. If you use a non-raid desktop drive which could go beyond 7 seconds while repairing a data error, a RAID controller can mark the disk as totally defective, and disconnect it from your raid array.<br/><br/>Generally people who use non RAID/NAS drives complain about losing entire raid arrays simply because of the way desktop drives handle errors. Look up the failure rate for non-raid drives used in a raid. It's disturbing. It is because normal hard disks don't have TLER enabled.<br/><br/>Now, TLER is simply a firmware setting, but at the time of this writing, it is not something you can change on desktop hard disks. In order to get TLER, you must spend more money on a NAS/RAID drive.<br/><br/>As an example, WD Greens will not work in a raid properly, because those drives do not have TLER. When used in a raid array they have been known to crash.<br/><br/>Furthermore you don't want to use a NAS/RAID drive without a raid controller. Because raid hard disks notify the raid controller of disk data errors, instead of trying to repair the data on their own like conventional desktop drives.<br/><br/>Desktop drives are good at handling errors because they can sit and grind away for 1 minute if necessary, repairing the disk, while a raid drive will time out, and force the controller to repair the bad data.<br/><br/>For best results, use a hardware raid controller with a NAS/RAID drive, and use desktop drives for software raid, or fake raid, or non-raid.<br/><br/>I purchased a used Adaptec 3405 Hardware raid card for $60 with a cable, and bought 2 of these drives for RAID 1 (mirror.) This combination required absolutely no software drivers, no software installation, just plug and play.<br/><br/>To create an array you do it before the computer boots up, by accessing the Adaptec 3405 raid card bios. This doesn't require any drivers, so you don't need a floppy disk drive, or internet, or a CD Rom. After configuration of a hardware raid card, Linux OS or Windows OS sees the raid array as one single drive.<br/><br/>If you are using fake raid, which is the raid built in on your motherboard, you will need to install drivers to get the fake raid to work.<br/><br/>Hardware raid is the easiest, fastest thing I've ever seen, and for $60 to have a hardware raid card, it seems pointless to use the built in motherboard ""fake raid"" which is a software raid.<br/><br/>With hardware raid 1 (mirror), if a drive starts making noises or indicates an error, you simply pull it out and replace it with any new one of the same capacity, doesn't have to be the exact brand or model of the original. The hardware raid will automatically start rebuilding the new drive.<br/><br/>With the hardware raid, I experimented by unplugging one of the drives from the hardware raid card, and plugging it into my motherboard SATA port. The disk reads just like a conventional hard disk, the hardware raid card does not render a hard disk unreadable. In the event that a raid card dies, if using Raid 1, you can just remove a drive and plug it into any onboard SATA port, then you have your data back.",104.99,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"January 11, 2014",So Smooth!

ASUS X200 11-Inch Laptop [OLD VERSION],3.5,Charles Seiler,"This laptop is very fast, very overkill for 99% of home users (except hardcore gamers, video editors, or music editors). It does not come with Office, so you will need to download and install Open Office or Word, or something and pay for the additional software. However, this laptop provides native support for Windows 7, meaning Asus offers drivers to install Windows 7 properly. I searched for a couple days and had trouble installing Windows 7, but it is really very easy, so I will tell you how to do it on this laptop. You'll want to make sure you verify this exact model on Asus's website (I have the 4GB ram version of the XC200A) but don't see it listed on Amazon anymore. Check the manufacturer website to see if they offer Windows 7 64 bit drivers. To install Windows 7, do the following. Follow this exactly or it won't work at all. 1.) Download Rufus. 2.) Burn your Windows 7 CD to a Bootable USB stick, Format to MBR for UEFI Bios (not GPT). This laptop comes with GPT partitions, which is unnecessary and won't work in some situations with Windows 7, and is only for over 2 Terabyte drives, so make your USB boot disk in a MBR format using Rufus. Format the USB drive in FAT32 format. 2.) Restart Windows, holding the SHIFT plus SHUTDOWN in Windows 8. This gives you the option to do a real shut down, not a pseudo shut down. Power the computer back on, press the F2 key over and over, before the boot logo appears. You should see a bios screen (This computer uses a secure bios). You need to disable the ""Secure Boot"" option or any other security settings. Now, enable CSM, and enable everything listed underneath CSM. If you don't disable security and enable CSM you cannot install a new Windows 7 installation. Now, put the USB stick and restart the computer. Press F2 again to go to the bios screen. Now find the boot order in the settings, and select the USB stick. Do not select UEFI, but select the USB stick line item that does not say UEFI in front of the name. You want to do a non UEFI install of Windows 7 because UEFI is a new process using new protocols and new partitions that you don't need. 3.) Keep the USB stick in, now restart the computer. It should begin booting off the USB installation thumb drive. Be sure to delete all the partitions and let Windows choose the new ones. It should only create one system partition and one main partition, for a total of (2) partitions. If it creates 3, don't continue, you did something wrong, probably burning the wrong installation with Rufus. You need to be making a ""Master Boot Record"" partition scheme, which is one MBR partition and one SYSTEM partition, just like the old days of Windows 7. You may not be able to get Windows registered properly if you don't do this, so beware, you only want 2 partitions. 4.) Install Windows. Done.",306.00,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"December 25, 2013",Very Fast and Supports Windows 7,Yes,5,5,26
"MagLite LED 3-Cell D Flashlight, Black",4.8,Charles Seiler,"I wanted a survival flashlight, a flashlight for spotting animals in the forest at night, and a light that was bright enough to signal air traffic up in the sky. This light is bright enough for all these purposes. It also has endless battery life. I used it for 2 weeks on an off and the batteries were still fully charged. The batteries have lasted 4 months now, of on and off usage and are still fully charged. The big selling point of this light is that it is extremely bright very white, piercing light. It's a perfect balance of brightness and battery life. I would not want it any brighter, because it is more important that your flash light be fully charged and ready to use, otherwise it won't serve its purpose in case of an emergency.<br/><br/>The thing about flash lights is you never know when you will need one, they are mostly used for emergencies, or unplanned events, and they also spend a lot of time sitting on a shelf. You want a flash light that has tremendous, ridiculously long battery life. I searched all the flash lights they sell at Walmart, or in most stores, and this flashlight has the longest battery life of any comparable light.<br/><br/>Don't listen to anyone saying it's not bright. Yes, you can get a brighter light, but those super bright lights that use AA or AAA batteries - they are totally absolutely useless because they may seem brighter, but they go dead so fast you never get a chance to use them!<br/><br/>This light is perfectly bright (anymore brightness would not be necessary for a hand held light. In my opinion if this light isn't bright enough for you, then it means you will need to switch to a stationary 120 volt work light or a 12 volt style light, and a simple flash light won't work for you anyway.)<br/><br/>For hunting UFOs and aliens, ghosts, or big foot, this is your light. You can click the button on and off rapidly to do Morse code signals to communicate with any non human potential life forms.<br/><br/>Or you can use this flash light for self defense. I've owned dozens of flash lights. I will be buying about 4 more of these for everyone in my family. This light is great for carrying, and as a companion, check out the Sportsman 90 hour rated - 3D battery - LED lantern by Rayovac, a small hand held lantern, which also has exceptional limitless battery life.

"Rayovac SE3DLNACOM Sportsman 240 Lumen 3D LED Lantern, Green",4.6,Charles Seiler,"Sometimes a product is so much better than all other similar products that it makes you wonder how the other products even sell at all. This product is really THAT good. I bought this awhile back and it has the best battery life as compared to all other similar LED products. LED lights come in 2 flavors, either they have super bright LEDs and terrible battery life, or they have awful light output and endless battery life. However, they do make a 3rd, more rare version of LED lights, that have both qualities of being super bright, and super long lasting, and this lantern has both - bright lights, and endless battery life. Beware of any LED product that does not tell you what the battery life is, because I've owned several LED flashlights that die within minutes, sometimes lasting only 1 hour or less, which is not acceptable, considering that other LED products with the same brightness can last for days, upon days. This Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern has a very heavy duty, quality feel to it, with a metal handle coated in rubber! I didn't know they still used metal? I am very impressed!

Motorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Black/White,3.4,Charles Seiler,"I was going to write a glowing review. These sound and work great. Then I saw a customer review saying his headphones cracked. Well I looked at mine, and SURE ENOUGH they are CRACKED! I have owned them 6 months and have taken very good care of mine, no abuse whatsoever. I can't believe they are cracked. Strangely enough the crack wasn't noticeable, I'm sure they have been cracked for awhile now since I've not inspected them since they were purchased as a gift for me.<br/><br/>Sound is awesome.

LG 50PA4500 50-Inch 720p 600 Hz Plasma HDTV (2012 Model),4,Charles Seiler,"When it comes to audio and video, I would say I am entry level expert. I do video editing, build computers, process video formats, and use this TV as a computer monitor in addition to using it as a regular TV.<br/><br/>My friend bought the same type of TV although he bought a Samsung 50 inch 720 P plasma. The Samsung will not run at its native resolution from a PC computer using HDMI cord. What this means is the Samsung picture does not look like it should when you're using a PC (lap top). However this TV does run at its native resolution of 1280 x 720, using an old Toshiba laptop, so this LG TV has the correct aspect ratio when you're watching movies from a small laptop using the RGB input. I have also tested this LG TV with an HDMI input and it also runs at 1280 x 720 directly from an HP lap top. You have to go to your monitor properties in Windows and uncheck the box that says ""hide unsupported modes"" and then you have to change the ""adapter"" settings in windows display settings, to 1280 x 720 @ 50hz, then you can use this TV as a monitor. It will look perfect this way when playing movies, as the aspect ratio (width/height) will be correct. Running any widescreen TV at 1024 x 768 will not yield the correct aspect ratio, and people will look short and fat, which is a huge problem if you actually want to get what you paid for.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare electronic devices that has literally blown my mind with its features. At of all the things that I have purchased in my life, this TV has been the best value, it has the most features, and it is the most underrated of any device I have ever seen on the market.<br/><br/>The single main negative: There is no bass to speak of from the speakers. However the speakers produce very natural sound, it is not a hollow sound, the voices are extremely clear and accurate, the treble is perfectly pitched and not too high, and the sound field appears to be coming from the center of the TV. On this LG TV the speakers are located on the bottom and the sound field sounds like it is coming from the center of the picture, it is truly amazing how they were able to make the sound so clean and so accurate. The only downside as I said is there is no bass but this is not really a downside considering the accuracy of the sound. Bear in mind a lot of Samsung TV's have speakers in the back. Try to avoid is rear facing speakers unless you don't plan on using the TV speakers. I don't have surround sound and don't want surround sound, this TV has very clean sound, and the voices are crisp and powerful. To me the voices are most important, along with the accuracy of the sound. This TV succeeds in both departments.<br/><br/>Now to the most important part. You can plug a external hard drive into the side of this TV, and it will play any video. What it gives you is a menu that shows you all of the information on your hard drive. The menu is extremely user-friendly. This TV will play AVI files, H.264 (.mp4) files. It it will play MKV files and everything in between. However what is truly amazing is the way that it upscales the video. No matter what you throw at it, using the USB port on the side of the TV, whether it be a memory stick or an external hard drive, it makes the video look absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>I have found some video files were the audio will not play. These are MKV files. All the AVI files have played perfectly thus far. I have tested about 70 videos, all of them played perfectly, some of the MKV files did not have audio though. Overall the video codecs are some of the best I've ever seen, the video codecs are responsible for decoding video when you are using the USB input on the side.<br/><br/>The audio codecs are a little short on this TV however, only because some MKV files do not play audio. This is not much of a downside as MKV files are not common on the Internet for downloads. Most MKV files are 1.5 GB or larger. You can just download AVI files which are known as divx, this LG TV, will play all divx files that I have seen, and the audio is perfect. Chances are if you can find a file that is MKV, you can also find the same movie in AVI format. That's what I had to do for some movies.<br/><br/>Now there is some debate whether you need a 1080 P TV, or a 720 P TV. You do not need a 1080 P TV, unless you are using a Blu-ray player. Personally I do not like Blu-ray discs due to their cost. I play all of my videos through the TVs USB port or from the RGB input on the back of the TV, from my laptop. If you use a 1080 P TV, the quality of downloaded movies, or old movies that are not Blu-ray, is actually reduced, because the TV has too many pixels, and the video must be scaled up to be much larger than it really is. A 720 P TV, actually has larger pixels, and less pixels, therefore there is less up-scaling needed when you are starting with a small, non-Blu-ray, video. What this means is 720 P makes most video look better, unless it is a Blu-ray. Most video is not Blu-ray, and if that's all you are watching, then you might benefit from a totally different TV.<br/><br/>I am using a laptop with the RGB output, and this is plugged directly into the TV which also has an RGB input. RGB is a standard monitor cable from the old computers, before they went with HDMI, and DVI. This TV does not have a DVI input, however most computers have an RGB, or an HDMI output. Therefore you should be able to hook any computer to this TV. Beware that most TVs do not have an RGB input anymore. This was a tremendous benefit when researching this TV, and is one of the reasons I purchased it. If your laptop or computer does not have an HDMI, then you cannot hook it to most big-screen TVs, unless they have an RGB input, like this LG TV.<br/><br/>The picture is outstanding with rich colors, and the viewing angle does not change no matter where you are in the room. The picture is just as bright up and down and side to side. You can see the picture from halfway across the room very clearly. The picture is extremely bright and I actually set it to a lower setting because it is so bright.<br/><br/>This TV does make a hissing noise that is very faint due to it being a plasma TV. You can hear this hissing when there's no music or audio playing, when the TV is being used as a monitor or there is a silent scene in a movie, although I've never noticed it when watching a movie. My old Panasonic 42 inch plasma seemed quieter than this. I am very picky about my electronics, and the hissing is not an issue at all, since it is so faint.<br/><br/>For the price I cannot believe that they even make a TV this good. The fact that it plays all ""downloaded"" movies with ease, except for a few MKV files that have no audio, and the level of picture quality, along with the user-friendliness of all the menus, and the very convenient button layout on the remote, I am somewhat shocked to be honest. My last Panasonic TV had none of these features, it cost $100 more, and it burned out within two years of barely using it, developing a large black stripe down the side.<br/><br/>I am sold on LG TVs now and I would gladly purchase another. I have watched it almost nonstop for three weeks. I can assure you that I've tested it with more tests than any normal person would ever dare to do. The only thing I haven't done is play a Blu-ray disc from a Blu-ray player, but I have played Blu-ray files and they look outstanding.<br/><br/>I would recommend this TV to anybody. I also think that the 50 inch size is perfect, there is a noticeable difference from a 42 inch, and it seems just right for most viewing. I plan on keeping this TV for as long as I can, until it kicks the bucket. I could never see a reason to replace it.",42.95,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"November 27, 2012",This is better than all the TV's on the Market,,,,22
The Key: A True Encounter,3.9,Charles Seiler,"I have been reading Whitley's work since I was 12 years old, in the 6th grade, when a book was handed to me as if by fate by a younger child on the school bus. He had accidentally ended up with the book ""Transformation"" and gave it to me, although he never read it himself and I had never read any alien books before this. I just purchased ""The Key"" because I felt an impending need to advance my spiritual awareness with something new. I get this impending desire and every year or so, when this desire hits me, I have to read non stop for several weeks until I feel sufficiently balanced with new information. The Key really exceeded my expectations. Strieber's writing is so compassionate and humble, and yet very articulate and intelligent. Most male authors are hard to follow because they write with too much intellectualism, and not enough sympathy for their reader. Strieber is incredibly intelligent, and has a way with words, but he writes with respect for his audience, in a way that is at once eloquent, and yet simple enough to understand for people who don't normally read at an extremely high level. (I don't read novels and so I have trouble with some male authors who tend to write with too many complex words crammed together which tends to bludgeon the senses and distract the reader from the content or message). I always find myself gliding through Strieber's work, as his writing has a clear fluidity. I feel calm and happy having read his work, as he is a true artist with his words. Now, onto to the content of this book. I have read supernatural books and alien books since I was 12. I am 29 now. I have many years of being exposed to very large subjects and I have spent many years having brief out of body experiences, time travel dreams, precognition, telepathy, and other strange paranormal events, including sleep paralysis, clear observations of a silent flying triangle with no lights on it, video tape footage of flying black orbs that I had dreamed about the night before I video taped them. I believe I have encountered spiritual beings of other dimensions myself. I have also read the work of Stewart Swerdlow, Dolores Cannon, Ashayanna Deanne, Barbara Marciniak, and Esther Hicks, which I recommend reading all of these authors. I have listed to Alex Collier, Charles Hall, Bob Dean, Bob Lazar, David Icke, and others who talk of reptilian control, or other strange things happening on Earth. Well, in summar, this book, The Key fits with everything I have ever read or learned. Most books immediately strike me as being wrong in so many ways, and packed with inaccurate information that cannot be corroborated. This is not the case with Striebers book. It actually summarizes the process of the soul in a way that agrees with many other books I have read. I immediately took a liking to this book and read it in 1 day, every page was extremely fascinating, although it's not a very large book, and certainly not a novel, but the content is more rich and concentrated than any small book I have ever read. Specifically the information about the soul, reincarnation and the ability to form a radiant body or astral body that is permanent, all coincides and agrees with the work of Dolore Cannon and Ashayanna Deanne. Dolores Cannon just published a new book, called ""The Convoluted Universe - Part 4"" that actually indicates the same principles, that some people here on Earth are not useful people, they are so controlled, that their soul has no been allowed to form a radiant body, and when they die, they do not have sufficient energy to maintain their own indemnity, and will instead be fused back into creation, lost forever as a fragment. However, some of us, about 50% of the people who have lived on Earth, have been able to form a permanent radiant body. What this means is that people who are asleep and who seem brain washed, really are lost souls. These people need help, and I have always sensed that, but now after reading this book and seeing the information corroborated with Dolores Cannon's books, and Ashayanna Deanes books, I feel that people who are close minded are truly facing the possibility of being destroyed, and lost forever, and these people, if they are to continue on into an afterlife, and get a chance at being either reborn or allowed to continue on in the form of an astral being, they need to open their minds.<br/><br/>Now, this book contains some problems. One problem is that the person Strieber encounters never outright says he is not a machine. He answers Strieber's inquiry about this matter by saying ""If I was a machine I would deceive you."" Some of the words in this book therefore, could be a deception, although my gut feeling is that most of it is all correct. What strikes me as being incorrect, is the notion that Humans come from primates who were forced to evolve because of natural pressure. In Dolores' books, Swerdlows interviews, Icke's research, Ashayanna's books, and other material, it is clearly indicated that Human life didn't start on Earth, Earth is a colony that was started by reptilians and original humans from Lyra, and the current Human form is a hybrid of reptilian and mammalian genetics, this is why we have such unstable and yet compulsive tendencies, and why it is hard to reach balance, because we are a hybrid species with 2 different baseline genetics that are always fighting for control, and these impulses make it difficult being a Human. I saw an old man recently that has perfectly formed vertical pupils and blue green eyes. I have also seen a person walking in Montana with blue eyes, and he had perfectly formed reptilian pupils. Because I've seen these people in person, it lends more credibility to the reptilian theory. Swerdlow says that reptilians were on Earth first, and are the controllers now, however they reached a compromise allowing the Human hybrid to be created. Instead of fighting for control over the planet, an agreement was made to create the current version of the Human, with genetics from both factions being shared with us. The royal bloodlines on Earth contain more reptilian genetics than ordinary citizens, and this is where the feudal system comes from, ""the right to rule, based on your bloodline.""<br/><br/>In the end I am not sure what to believe, and I am open to all suggestions and this is why I enjoy reading. However, I do not entertain the idea that monkeys turned into humans naturally without intervention, and I think any book that talks about evolution and forces it upon us as being the reason for Human existence, is obviously disinformation, or misinformation. If you study the true fossil record, you will see that many archeologists have found 8 foot tall human skeletons, some being even larger than that, and many human remains have been found that far pre-date even the oldest remains of monkeys, so humans were apparently here long before primates. The actual physical evidence on Earth is completely against the process of evolution. Evolution does happen, but it doesn't create a new intelligent race of beings overnight, as is the case with Humans. Research Lloyd Pie, and the alien skull he has called the ""Star Child Skull."" This is a real alien skull in the possession of Lloyd Pie. Or research ""Hidden Archeology"" a book that has several essays written about famous discoveries that can easily disprove what is taught as ""evolution.""<br/><br/>This book, The Key, is amazing and I am very glad I purchased it. But I will need to spend some time reflecting on it's meanings, and corroborating it. I would remain slightly skeptical about it, only because the person who Strieber met does indeed have a sense of negativity about him, and inspiring fear into people can cause chaos in its self, by forcing people to think about something negative, which then uses the power of the conscious mind, together collectively, to create that negative reality. Realities can be altered or made to be more probable simply by feeding a mass of people a negative thought, and this thought creates a new template of reality. So if you do read this, please keep a positive uplifted mind, do not allow it to scare you.",11.67,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"July 29, 2012",Excellent - Except for 1 Major Theme,Yes,4,3,21
Shimano Deore 9-Speed Mountain Bicycle Rear Derailleur - RD-M591,4.8,Charles Seiler,"There are 3 types of derailleurs. Short, medium or long. I think you should always run a long cage derailleur, unless you are an expert and have road gears on your bike, not mountain gears. Mountain bikes have a wider range of sprocket sizes, therefore you need a derailleur which has a lot of chain control. A long cage derailleur is simply better at keeping the chain tight throughout all the gear ranges.<br/><br/>I was running a short cage derailleur, and it worked, but it didn't work well. The chain would strip under load in the highest gears (small front, small rear), when the chain slack was greatest. This happened, even with a brand new chain and rear sprocket (cassette). Putting on the new derailleur, the Deore M591, required no modification to the chain. It simply bolted on, and it fixed all problems.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, I was skeptical that putting a new derailleur would help as much as it did. I had tuned my old Acera deraileur over and over, but even when it was set perfectly, the shifts were sloppy, sometimes it wouldn't go into the correct gear, and often times the chain would come loose and fall off completely while crossing the street and going off a tall curb, this was very dangerous.<br/><br/>By simply bolting on this Deore M591, my GT 21 speed MTB with a Shimano hyperglide rear cassette and new hyperglide chain, shifts absolutely perfect. The shifts are instant, and almost silent. I am extremely impressed. The chain is silent now, and never makes any noise no matter what gear you are in. I shifted about 300 times in 2 hour period to test the derailleur, and the chain never once missed a shift or struggled to make it to the next gear, which is really outstanding.<br/><br/>Here is how I put the derailleur on:<br/><br/>There is no need to cut your chain, most likely it will work without lengthening the chain. Mine worked fine without modifying or breaking my chain, and I switched from a totally different short cage derailleur to this long cage M591 Deore. [Note: I did eventually replace my chain to a new Shimano chain since the old one was in very bad condition, but this isn't always necessary.]<br/><br/>I removed the sprockets on this Shimano Deore M591 derailleur and put it on, then I put the sprockets (pulleys) back on. You will need some allen wrenches to do this work. I used some blue thread locker on the primary attachment bolt to the frame. I also put a tiny dab of fresh blue thread locker on the tiny pulley bolts, being careful not to get any thread locker on the bolt shaft, only the threads. The pulleys are the tiny sprockets on the derailleur.<br/><br/>To set the derailleur, put the chain on, and pedal the bike before you attach the shift cable to the derailleur. Set the screw that says H, by backing it out slowly until the chain shifts to the smallest sprocket. Now attach the shift cable while your shifter is set to the highest gear 7/8/9 or 10 (the highest gear.) Pull the cable snug, just enough to take out loose slack, and then tighten down the cable hold down bolt on the derailleur. This should be all you need to do. You can fine tune by turning the cable housing adjustment screw on the back of the derailleur counter clockwise, to tighten the cable a little bit until your shifting matches the numbers on your shift lever, or feels correct to you depending on what type of shift mechanism you have.<br/><br/>There are 2 other settings you need. If you are installing this yourself. You need to set the L screw. When you are shifting, if your bike chain will not go onto the largest sprocket in the rear, loosen the L screw. If your chain jumps past the large sprocket, tighten this screw, by turning it clockwise a little at a time, until your lowest gear (number 1) on your shifter, pushes your chain onto the largest sprocket, and the chain should not be making any clicking noises.<br/><br/>The final setting is the B screw, or tension screw adjustment on the back of the derailleur. Put your bike in the lowest gear, biggest rear sprocket. Now adjust the little tension screw that pushes on the frame until your top idler pulley (top derailleur sprocket) is 1/8"" away from the largest rear sprocket on your rear wheel, you want a very close clearance, but not touching. That's it! You're done!<br/><br/>To make your shifts much better, before assembling anything, take a rag with a few drops of oil on it, and wipe your exposed portions of your shift cable with a light coating of oil. The coating of oil will prevent oxidation of the cable and cable housing, and reduces friction. (Oiled cables make a bike feel new again.)<br/><br/>With a long cage Derailleur, my chain is now much tighter all the time, and yet I can ride in any gear combination without any chain problems whatsoever, I can ride with the large front sprocket, and large rear sprocket without the chain binding, and I have a 32 tooth rear and a 48 tooth front! I also have a 28 tooth front and a 12 tooth rear, and any of the combinations of these are perfect. The chain is roughly twice as tight in the same conditions as compared to my Acera. To test my bike I went on a 5 miles ride through the city, and also went to a skate park with jumps. I pedaled hard the entire time, and never once had a problem. I went off some small jumps and bumps and tried to create a problem, but my bike shifted perfect the entire time. I also noticed that I am not able to strip the chain under hard pedaling, and the chain never falls off when I go off a curb anymore. All of this is because of the new derailleur. The Deore M591 has impressed me more than any other part I've put on my bike so far. Once it was set, it worked perfect for the rest of the night, and never needed any fine tuning. Amazing.",29.89 - $67.95,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"May 1, 2012",My Experience &amp; Installation Instructions,Yes,4,3,20
WEN 61720 3/4-Inch to 2-Inch 18-Gauge Brad Nailer,4.7,Charles Seiler,"This is a Pneumatic tool meaning you need at least a very tiny air compressor to run this. The tiniest 120 volt portable air compressors will run these, most of the very cheap small air compressors are less than $100. If you don't own an air compressor, I will tell you it's a safe investment. They last for 20 years or more, I bought one 14 years ago, and have never changed the oil or done anything. If you want it to last forever, get an ""oil"" air compressor not an ""oil free."" They cost about more, but they last forever. As for the size, just go with the largest one you can afford, and make sure it's portable, and something that you can haul in your vehicle if you need to take it somewhere for a project.<br/><br/>About the 18 gauge brad nailers:<br/><br/>I purchased a Harbor Freight 18 gauge brad nailer. I was very happy with the performance, but I noticed that the rear latch was made of soft plastic. If you dropped it once it would shatter the rear latching mechanism into bits. I returned it and got my $32 back (after tax). I went to all the major websites, Home Depot, Sears, Lowes, but Amazon had lower prices on all the different models of air nailers. I have been a mechanic and carpenter for 16 years. I built my own air compressor when I was a kid, so I have a very good understanding of air tools, and tools in general. I have not tried the WEN yet, as I just ordered it. But here are some selling points.<br/><br/>1.) The Dewalt has a lot of bad reviews about it jamming<br/>2.) The Harbor Freight nailer spits a lot of oil out and can be messy, and had no power adjustment. It is also made of soft cheap plastic.<br/>3.) The NuMax looks good, and will work fine, although it has no power adjustment, and no quick release to take the front apart to clear out jams. If you get a jam, it will take 5 minutes to fix it, instead of 1 minute.<br/>4.) The Hitachi looks poorly made, the rear latch mechanism doesn't look like it's made out of metal, and the tool is ugly! But this is just my opinion, more research is needed to see if the rear latch is made of soft plastic.<br/>5.) The other brands, Porter Cable, Campbell Hausfield, etc, are too expensive.<br/>6.) The WEN has<br/>  A.) Depth adjustment. This is important because a normal brad nailer set at full power at 120 psi will blast a nail so far into the wood that you won't ever see it again. You need either to regulate the pressure down to 70 psi or maybe even lower for some very soft woods, or some type of power adjustment on the tool. The Wen has this adjustment capability so you can use it without turning your pressure way down at the air compressor. Most air compressors come with a factory air regulator, so it's not the end of the world if your air tool has no adjustments. It will still work fine without them. But I wanted the convenience of not adjusting the air pressure all the time.<br/>  B.) The WEN has a quick release to remove the front piece to clear out jammed nails.<br/>  C.) The WEN has a METAL latch on the back, and it's on the side of the tool, not sticking straight out the back like some. This means you would have to try  really hard to damage the rear latch mechanism, and it looks about 10 times stronger than the Harbor Freight tool I returned which was only $13 less.<br/>  D.) Good reviews, no jams.<br/><br/>Now if you purchase the Wen and want to use 2"" brads, use Bostich brand only, as they are the correct length.<br/><br/>I will post more after I've received and used the tool for a few months.<br/><br/>March 24, 2013<br/><br/>I've now owned the tool for 1 year. I have built many things with it, I have never had a single jam. My original review still stands. I have used the longest nails you can possibly use in this tool, the 2 inch nails, and it drives them in with power to spare and leaves a tiny pin head print, without damaging the surrounding wood, unlike the cheap staple/brad nail combo guns which leave the very large chunk out of the wood from the staple driver head, this WEN only leaves a tiny, tiny dent in the wood, which is not really noticeable, so it is good for finish work, and the adjustment for depth does work perfect, so you can protect ""over driving"" the head into the work piece for fine finish work, but it will take a couple test shots to see how much depth you want.<br/><br/>I noticed when driving the 2"" nails, it has more than enough power, and doesn't jam, although using such a long nail is much stronger, it is difficult to drive them straight because any angle at all will be amplified when attaching two thin 1/2"" pieces of plywood together using an excessively long brad nail (2 inches), which doesn't leave much room for error. I still enjoy using the 2"" brad nails that I bought from Harbor Freight which work perfect in this gun, because they are stronger than the shorter ones, although I don't feel that it's necessary.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>1.) Oil can shoot out of this gun from the top vent onto your work piece. That's the only disadvantage I've seen so far. However, you can turn the vent to the side and it will blow away from your work piece, rather than on top of it, so that's something that is up to the user to control. Also you could very easily put a small rag on top of this WEN brad nailer to cover the exhaust port when doing ultra fine finish work to protect 100% from oil. However, I built several boxes with fine oak veneer plywood and during that time with 60 brad nails I only had oil fall on the wood 1 time (and it easily sanded off) because I wasn't paying attention to the direction of the vent on top.<br/><br/>2.) I love love this brad nailer. The handle is super comfortable. I've never owned a nailer, although I've owned over 30 air tools, this one has a quality feel to it, it's not very heavy, but not plastic and cheap either.<br/><br/>3.) Pressure does need to be reduced below 120-90 psi for ideal results, because you don't need full pressure, even with 2"" inch brad nails this gun has more than adequate power to get the job done, so either use the limiter on the tool for depth, or reduce the pressure. I found that reducing the pressure down to about 60 psi was all that I needed to do to get perfect depth control without changing any settings on the tool. Your results will vary. Most air compressors have a small black control knob near the tank, with an output pressure gauge, this is so you can reduce the pressure for nail guns, and paint gun.<br/><br/>The case is not very well made, but the tool its self is very high quality. Overall, after 1 year I'm extremely happy and would never trade this tool for anything. Well worth the investment.",32.09,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"April 26, 2012",Better than Harbor Freight,Yes,4,3,19
Rockford Fosgate Prime R152 5.25-Inch Full Range Coaxial Speakers (Discontinued by Manufacturer),3.6,Charles Seiler,"Listen carefully, people write reviews and they have NO IDEA what they are talking about. These speakers will sound terrible in a tiny sealed box. They will literally blow your mind in giant ported box, built exactly to spec at 0.43 cubic feet, with a 1 1/8"" diameter port x 1/2"" long, stuffed with loose polyfill to give them a less ""hollow"" sound.<br/><br/>Here is my story:<br/><br/>They are so loud in a properly sized ported box that they literally shake your body with powerful tight bass running 50 watts to each one from a Sony amplifer. Until today, I had never built a properly sized ported box for a tiny 5 1/4"" speaker. I had used them for 10 years in 0.25 cubic foot sealed boxes, where they had no bass at all. I enjoy building speaker boxes, so I decied to try my hand at putting these in ported boxes, because ported boxes are the ONLY way to fly if you want bass. Sealed boxes don't produce high levels of bass, they produce flat, plain, boring bass, which is... boring!<br/><br/>I made 2 boxes, each 22.25 x 5.75 x 8 3/8 inches (outside diameter). The inside diameter is 21.25 x 4.75 x 7 3/8 inches, using 1/2 thick oak veneer plywood. The port is simply a 1 1/8"" hole drilled in the center of the back side of the box. This is exactly what the tuning calculations call for. Now, these boxes with these speakers, running at 50 watts, are altogether a different animal. These are so powerful, with such tight clean bass, that after 15 years of building hundreds of speakers boxes, I am blown away. I had no idea you could make this much bass from 5 1/4"" speakers. The bass shakes the room, and you can feel it in your chest, and yet there is ZERO distortion, the speakers hardly move at all, because the tuned box resonates with the speaker, and dampens the cone, so it doesn't fly back and forth.<br/><br/>After hearing these, I highly recommend these for home audio speakers. That's what I am using them for, and they have such powerful, deep, clean bass, that you don't need a subwoofer, there is absolutely no need for a subwoofer. And I'm saying this from 15 years of audio experience. Again, I point to the other reviewers who say these have no bass. Well that's totally wrong, because it ALL DEPENDS ON THE ENCLOSURE!<br/><br/>These speakers sound good, and have accurate reproduction, probably because of the foam surround, which is fairly stiff, which probably helps in voice reproduction. Now, I bought Rockford Fosgate 6 3/4's for my car, and I am running them free air in my Tercel. The treble is so loud that I cannot use them. These speakers really are too bright (with too much treble). However, strangely, if you put them in a ported enclosure, it bolsters the bass and midrange tremendously, and it brings it up to match the sharp treble, and you get this amazing, jaw dropping speaker that has such accurate clear sound that it's really hard to believe, when you compare it to the terrible sound they make in a car, running free air, where they have almost no midrange or bass. I would suggest if you are going to use these, they are absolutely worthless without a box. With a large tuned ported box, they are godly. Without an enclosure, or in a ""too small"" sealed box, they are absolutely awful, too bright, too shrill, and not tolerable. I will be removing the 6 3/4's I put in my car, because they are too hard on my ears at volume.<br/><br/>The speakers aren't junk. They just require a box. And they do have bass. They have a TON of bass, and hit very low, chest rattling bass notes, clearly, WITH A BOX. So there you go :)",39.76,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"April 8, 2012",Ok Here is The Truth About These,Yes,8,8,18
"IOGEAR Multimedia Keyboard with Laser Trackball and Scroll Wheel, 2.4GHz Wireless GKM561R (Black)",4,Charles Seiler,"Best wireless keyboard I've ever used, hands down. The last Adesso keyboard I tried, had a 3 foot range. This keyboard works perfectly, it never ever ever ever ever misses a key, I've been typing on it all night, even from the couch, and I have even done typing tests, and it has not missed a single key that I have noticed. How's that for WIRELESS QUALITY. The track ball works perfect, and is heavy, contrary to popular opinion. It's very easy to use, and I find (much to my shock) that I now prefer the track ball to a touch pad. I was very sad buying this, because I didn't think I'd like the track ball, but I'll tell you, its very fast, and very accurate, and requires almost no effort to use it. The track ball is suprisingly simple and very easy to learn. The keypad has long throw keys, which I don't like. However, the keypad is very silky smooth, with a very precise feel to it, and the surfaces of the keys feel great, so I can type for a long time without fatigue, which is surprising, because my old keyboard caused a lot of fatigue all the time. The primary reason I bought this Iogear keyboard was to get something that was less fatiguing, and so far, I think I might have succeeded. This keyboard works so accurately that you can type from across the room and it never EVER misses a key. That's a perfect keyboard right there.<br/><br/>Update: 11/05/2011<br/><br/>I have been using this for a week or so now, and still agree with the review above. It's a very easy keyboard type on, much less fatiguing than my original desktop keyboard, and still never misses a key. I notice that it has disconnected for a brief second, but the letters still appear a second later on the screen - they don't just disapear like with other wireless keyboards - so this is a great keyboard when what you are writing is fairly important, and you don't want to re-type things over and over due to a keyboard disconnect. This keyboard has given me no trouble, I'm still astonished by the level of quality and reliability. It's unlike any wireless product I've ever used, in that it works 99.9999% of the time.

Adesso Wireless SlimTouch Desktop Touchpad Keyboard (WKB-4000UB),3.3,Charles Seiler,"I do a lot of typing and my hands get really sore on cheap conventional keyboards. Lap top keyboards have always been my favorite because they are designed properly, with a very short key stroke which doesn't strain your hands. Lap top keyboards seem to be more effecient, since the keys are easier to push and there is no wasted energy. Desktop keyboards waste a lot of energy due to the long key stroke, and the cheap sticky feel that all the new keyboards have. Well this keyboard doesn't have that cheap rubbery feel to the keys. Nor does it cause hand fatigue after 10 minutes of typing!<br/><br/>This is the best keyboard I've ever typed on. The keys have a solid click to them, and yet they are very easy to push, and the key travel is very small. You get the feel and feedback of an old IBM keyboard, with the soft ergonomics of a lap top keyboard. If you type a lot and get hand fatigue, this is a dream come true.<br/><br/>The problem is, with 2 different sets of batteries that I've tried, I cannot go beyond about 5 feet. Beyond 5 feet the keyboard just stops responding completely. I am using the batteries that came with the keyboard, so that could be the issue. I am charging a brand new set of NiMH AAA batteries and I am going to try those next.<br/><br/>The other problem is that this keyboard stops responding for no reason, and you cannot type at all for 10 seconds. It does this quite often. Every wireless device I've had does this. I have never liked wireless, but I have waited 5 years since using my last Microsoft 4000 keyboard/mouse combination (it had no range and could not keep up with my typing.) I thought this keyboard would completely adress the old problems of lack of range and random disconnects. So far, it's not perfect. It's a large improvement over the Microsoft junk I used 5 years ago, but still seems imperfect.<br/><br/>I will report back with the new set of batteries, if it changes the poor range or the random disconnects.",63.99,4.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"October 19, 2011",Typical Wireless Lag and Lack of Range,Yes,4,3,16
"Tazo Calm Tea, 24 Tea Bags",3.9,Charles Seiler,"I am a coffee drinker. I don't drink tea. However, I've tried various teas because I enjoy switching to tea when I'm not in the mood to caffeine. I tried Green Tea's but they actually made me very sick. I must have an adverse reaction to the strong chemicals in Green Tea, because I cannot stomach it in the morning. When I drink it, I get a headache and a strong stomach ache that lasts for about 5 hours. Green tea = toxic effect. Now, I could build up a tolerance to Green Tea, but I'd much rather not endure that much sickness. Green Tea also tastes awful in my opinion.<br/><br/>By accident I purchased this tea from Walmart, where it is always sold out, because it seems to be the most popular tea at the local Walmart I go to. When I first tried this tea I was hooked. It has a sweet fragrant aroma, but not an overpowering fragrance. I don't like bitter teas, and this isn't bitter. It is a very nice flavor that I cannot describe. However, it makes the best hot or cold tea. My G/F who is not a tea drinker opened a bottle of ICED tea I made with this ""Calm"" tea. She said it was the best iced tea she had ever drank. She immediately wanted to buy more of this tea so we could make dozens of bottles of iced tea. For many months we drank only the ""Calm"" iced tea instead of regular water, because it gives the water such a soothing aroma and sweet taste. Only 1 tea bag per 2 liters of water is required and the water gets a very gentle aromatic flavor that is the best iced tea I've ever had.<br/><br/>I really love this tea. The only thing it could use more of is some licorice, because I prefer a sweeter taste. But you can put a small spoon of sugar in this and it is the most enjoyable sweet treat. Yes, I know I'm not a real hardcore tea enthusiast, and maybe I shouldn't be writing any reviews on tea, but I just wanted to compliment this tea and I hope it never goes away!",9.22,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"November 16, 2010",The best tea I've ever had,Yes,4,3,15
Rockford Fosgate Prime R1693 6 x 9-Inch Full-Range 3-Way Speakers (Pair),4.5,Charles Seiler,"I prefer paper woofers any time of the day. Paper woofers sound very natural and have a very nice mid range boom to them. Factory car speakers are ussually made out of paper, and they highlight mid range vocals very well. To those with less audio experience you won't notice the difference between paper woofers and mylar or poly woofer cones, but I can tell the different immedietely. I was worried about these speakers, since my dodge neon had paper cone speakers and paper tweeters that sounded amazing. However, the Dodge Neon speakers were paper and were ruined because of moisture. That is why paper doesn't work good for cone material with automotive use, since there is always moisture in a car.<br/><br/>These Rockford Fosgate 6"" x 9""s have a slightly mechanical sound, as do all of the plastic cone woofers. There is less mid range, tight bass, and very high highs. I do miss the mid range sound, but with a little adjusting on an EQ, you can get the sound back. The only mark against these speakers is that they are slightly lacking in the mid range boom that is so noticeable with paper cone woofers. However, this is more of a personal preference thing, than a real blemish against these speakers. There is nothing bad to say about these speakers. They are as tough as any I've used. I can turn them up to maximum volume and the car sounds like it has a subwoofer in it, because these speakers have so much bass, and can handle so much power with ZERO distortion. It is amazing how tough these are. If you are looking for crisp sound, tight bass, and incredible highs, then these speakers will definitely do it. They do not have any distortion at even the highest listening levels, I've not been able to hear any audible bass distortion even with the bass turned up. Very well designed. I'm using them on my rear lid, below the rear window on my 4 door Dodge Neon. They don't have any enclosures, and yet they sound awesome with tight bass. Free air apparently works fine for these!<br/><br/>These are very loud speakers and overwhelm my front speakers with the extreme highs. I wouldn't recommend putting in these speakers on their own, without getting a matched set. The thing is, these have a very sharp tight sound, and that will not merge well with a soft natural sound of front factory speakers. The treble coming from these speakers is hard to miss, so I'd recommend a matched set, with front 6"" round speakers for the doors, that way you have a matched sound coming from the front to back, and consequently, much better sound. I have 3 way front speakers, but they are not made by Rockford Fosgate, and the difference in sound between the front and back is slightly annoying to me. However, that's just me. It's a personal preference.<br/><br/>These speakers are built solid and can handle anything you can throw at them. Don't leave them in the sun, because that will ruin the foam surrounds.<br/>Love these! Will probably buy another set of the 6"" for the front of my car. I can't imagine finding anything that comes anywhere close to these for the price. Amazing.",42.99,5.0,A3JKKA12IN56I1,"October 30, 2010",Tough as Nails and Good Sound,Yes,4,3,14
Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,3.9,Pri,"This is a great product. I am someone who hates to floss my teeth but have a family history of dental disease. My dentist finally convinced me that I must floss one way or another if I am to avoid dental disease and that a waterpik would be better than not flossing at all. I didn't want to spend a lot on the fancier models so I'm glad I found this. It works just fine and gets the job done. Takes a while to get used to operating it, but once you do, it's quick and almost painless. The stream of water may hurt gums if they're sensitive or you're not used to flossing, but your gums will get used to it. Thankfully this includes a low pressure tip for sensitive gums.<br/><br/>It doesn't remove particles in between teeth as well as string floss, but it comes quite close. I tested its effectiveness by flossing with string after using waterpik and brushing and found that waterpik had removed at least 90 percent of the food particles that I would normally find on the string.<br/><br/>The cons to this are that the water reservoir needs to be refilled often and that its initially quite awkward to use and you end up making a mess by spraying water everywhere. But I believe using this waterpik, combined with being diligent about brushing before going to bed and flossing with string when I'm not feeling too lazy should significantly improve my dental health.",38.84,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"January 6, 2016",Great product,,,,56

Also, things tend to not fit me around the chest given that I'm breastfeeding. Combine that with stretch marks from pregnancy and it's needIess to say I do not feel comfortable wearing conventional bathing suits or bikinis. This bathing suit is perfect. I was worried about the quality and fit but it is absolutely wonderful and just like the picture. I have always dreaded having to wear a bathing suit in the pool and have resorted to wearing swim shorts over regular one piece suits. This covers everything you could possibly want covered while still looking feminine and flattering.<br/><br/>As far as sizing goes, I wear a size 8 or 10 currently and saw the reviews saying to go 2 sizes up, but I really wanted the navy one with red flowers which wasn't available in 2 sizes up from my normal size, large, which says it fits sizes 6-8. I decided to go with the large anyway. And when I got it it looked small but wow it fit perfectly. It's very fitted but doesn't feel tight. It fits me true to size because it has some nice stretch to it. Swim suits are supposed to be fitted and the fitting of this has a slimming effect. The flowy fabric that goes over it as the skirt is very flattering and hides problem areas. The bottom part is fitted shorts which are also flattering and not too revealing.<br/><br/>Upon receiving I saw that there are two flaps of the sheer fabric that hang from the breast area in the center and thought at first that it was a defect. Upon further investigation I realized that you're supposed to tie those into a bow in the front (not too apparent in the photos). Once those are tied it looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>I also read some reviews saying it shows too much cleavage. I did not find this to be a problem despite being a 36DD. There is a tiny amount of cleavage that you'd expect in any bathing suit but nothing outrageous. The padding in the chest area is also perfect as it provides good support and holds everything together.<br/><br/>Overall you can't go wrong with this bathing suit especially for the price. The other colors didn't appeal to me but the navy and red is beautiful.

"Bambo Nature Premium Baby Diapers, Midi, Size 3, 33 Count (Pack of 6)",4.5,Pri,"I read a lot of reviews saying the quality of these has deteriorated but having used them for a couple months now I can say that these are still the best diapers I have used, and I've gone through quite a few brands. I have to say that the more Eco-friendly ""green"" diapers are the way to go in general since the chlorine in your conventional brands seems to cause rashes when it becomes wet. Never had a single rash with any chlorine free diaper. That being said, Bambo is the best ""green"" diaper I have used in terms of fit, softness, and absorbency. I'll compare a few brands below:<br/><br/>Earth's best: these were too square and papery for me. And if it matters their design is rather unappealing compared to the cute bear on Bambo. Bambo definitely fits better and molds better to baby's body.<br/><br/>Honest: they are the cutest, but also papery, their new design doesn't fit as well, and they are more pricey. In my opinion the softness and comfort factor of Bambo makes it a better choice than honest.<br/><br/>Naty: I liked the fit and design of Naty far better than Bambo, but Naty has the scratchiest material around the leg area. I noticed redness on my daughter every time I changed her out of these so I will recommend Bambo over these for their softness alone.<br/><br/>In terms of absorbency, Bambo has been superior to all of the above. I am often surprised to see how dry it is when I take it off even though it is soaked. My baby's skin is always dry when I take it off, which allows me to feel comfortable letting her sleep in them all night. They do get a funny smell by morning when they're fully soaked but I don't think it's that big a deal given that they are super soft, haven't caused a single rash and feel so dry to the touch when taken off. I actually find that it is fine to be able to smell the urine when she pees so that I am always aware during the day that the diaper is wet and needs to be changed.<br/><br/>Also the back of the diaper comes up quite high which is great for preventing blowouts.

I don't think this should pose a SIDS risk for a baby who is old enough to correct their position if they find their face pressed against something. This probably isn't necessary for a newborn who won't be moving around enough to bang their head or stick their limbs through rails.<br/><br/>I initially tied this bumper incorrectly and thought it did not fit correctly. Upon retying, I find that the fit is just fine. A lot of the negative reviews saying it does not fit either have not tied it correctly or purchased it for a full size crib. This is for a mini crib only.<br/><br/>A tip on getting it on correctly: start by trying the strings on the two ends together and place the bumper in the crib with the two tied ends at a corner. The panel on one of the sides of the two tied ends is meant to fit perfectly on the shorter side of the crib so that the next set of strings fits the opposite corner. Positioned this way, there will be a tie at all four corners. Fasten the 4 corners first and then tie the strings that fall somewhere in the center of the longer rails.<br/><br/>In my photo the corner against the wall on the left side is where the two tied ends are.<br/><br/>The material is 100 percent cotton, does not feel scratchy, and the design is simple and functional; I bought the white one so I can match it with any color bedsheets.",31.84,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"September 14, 2015",Functions as intended if you tie it correctly on MINI crib,Yes,1,1,48

Also I felt as though I was applying a layer of grease on her bottom with every diaper change, which I imagine mustn't have felt too comfy. Cleaning up the diaper rash cream residue every time wasn't fun either. Furthermore the highest concentration of zinc oxide wasn't removing the rash.<br/><br/>Somehow this product WORKS! Within 24 hours of use my daughters rash has almost disappeared. And I absolutely love the consistency of this product. It goes on more like a layer of oil that isn't sticky at all to the touch.

A half pea size amount is all I need to cover the entire effected area. I still do wish the jar were larger given what it costs. Because newborns need diaper changes every 2 hours, I am using this quite frequently throughout the day so I will be curious to see how long it lasts.

I think however that the company is sending people the wrong case (this case) if they order clear and it has sparkles. The one I ordered is Matte Glitter and that one is transparent with sparkles but it's not matte. Although it's not completely clear either. It's like a frosty semi-transparent plastic which I like because you can't see little tiny dirt and dust particles that get under the case, which always happens with clear cases. You can still see the apple logo and tell what color the iPhone is through the case. I like it way better than many of the other cases I've bought. I have two clear ones by spigen and this one seems better constructed to me and feels better in the hand than those. The cutouts are precise and I actually like the fact that the volume buttons and power button have a cutout rather than being covered so there are no issues with pressing down on the buttons. The bottom cutouts are well aligned as well. The texture is that of a hard plastic but it's a flexible material. Some people said theirs doesn't have a lip around the sides for protection but mine does. I don't see my phone breaking if it falls with this case on.<br/><br/>The glitter is subtle - girly without being too blingy - and would go well with any color iPhone since it's more like a silvery white shimmer than glitter. It's also as slim as can be for a case that offers this much protection. Doesn't add too much bulk. Nothing beats the feeling of the naked iPhone 6, but if you want protection this is a good option.

The bottom cutouts on the bumper are a bit weird and that area tends to be a bit loose, but I haven't found it to be a nuisance. As many have mentioned the cutout for the speaker area isn't right and covers one speaker hole, but I haven't really noticed a reduction in sound volume or quality because of it; I mostly use headphones anyway when listening to anything on my phone so this is something I can easily overlook in light of all the other great features of this case.<br/><br/>Feel: It feels like smooth plastic. There are no seams around the bezel area that stick out and feel uncomfortable in the hands. The bezel area feels smooth and rounded. The bumper material does not have a rubbery feel. It, too, is smooth. My favorite aspect is how clicky the buttons are. The volume and power button are covered and the metallic color matches the gold iPhone well. The silent switch is open and easy to access.<br/><br/>Function: I haven't dropped my phone yet, but the corner and edges seem very well protected to me. I don't see the plastic on this case shattering unless the phone sustains a really intense fall as it seems pretty sturdy and well made.<br/><br/>Appearance: definitely one of the best looking cases I have come across. For someone who doesn't like the sparkles I would recommend getting the clear version of this case. But I think the sparkles add a lot to the gold iPhone and in contrast to clear cases, they hide any specks of dust that may get caught between the phone and the case (that's what irks me most when I use clear cases). While the buttons look more gold than silver to me, the gold is very subtle and not at all yellow so I think both the buttons and the sparkles would look silver if used with a silver iPhone. However I don't think this would match that well on the space grey iPhone; on that one I think the gold buttons might look more gold. I also enjoy the fact that Case-mate's branding on the case is extremely subtle and doesn't draw any attention whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, the case is as slim as it can be for the level of protection it offers. It doesn't feel clunky to me and definitely makes the super slippery iPhone feel a lot more substantial in my hands.<br/><br/>I couldn't find too many real photos of this case when I was looking into it, so I decided to upload a few close-ups to give a better idea of how it will look in person. :)",15.19,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"January 4, 2015",Found my favorite case.,Yes,2,0,42
"iPhone 6 Case, Spigen® [SOFT-FLEX] Soft TPU Case [Capsule] [Crystal Clear] Premium Clear Flexible Soft TPU Case for iPhone 6 (2014) - Crystal Clear (SGP10940)",3.9,Pri,"I like this case a lot better than the Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear case which I bought before I found this one. It is slimmer and lighter than the Ultra Hybrid and therefore less bulky. It looks like it will give a considerable amount of protection. The reasons I took off two stars: 1) It arrived with a considerable amount of dust on the inner part of the case, which I had to wipe off. 2) the case sort of sticks to the Apple logo, which is not so flattering. 3) there is a slight seam along the bezel of the case. The ultra hybrid didn't have that and I wish it were the same with this one.<br/><br/>I don't notice any yellowness on this case. But I actually don't really like the fact that turning the flash on seems to illuminate the entire case (and that's when it looks yellow). The buttons work fine.<br/><br/>Overall I find it to be mediocre and I don't see myself using it until I find something better.<br/><br/>Regarding phones cracking - it seems to be determined by the angle at which the phone drops. This does have a slight lip that rises above the bezel, but if it falls flat on the screen it may just crack - to guarantee protection against that sort of scenario, you'd have to invest in a much bulkier case. In my experience with iphones, I can say the screens are pretty sturdy. I dropped my old iphone 5 hundreds of times, and when it finally did crack, it was the glass on the back that shattered - if I'd been using a case, that probably wouldn't have happened. The design of this case is such that a fall in which there is impact on the corner probably would not cause any damage. I'm a frequent phone dropper and I've noticed that most falls do impact the corners usually which are well protected here. If the phone does crack, it's not a flaw with the case, as it is not advertised as one that provides maximum protection against such impact.",10.99,3.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"December 31, 2014",I like this case a lot better than the Spigen Ultra ...,Yes,2,0,41

Don't know if I received a fluke, because the reviews suggested that this would be a good quality skin.<br/><br/>When I hear the term ""liquid skin"" I expect that the case will have a smooth texture - this one has a sharp seam along the bezel that makes holding it rather unpleasant. So even though the case is super thin material, you are constantly aware that it's there because of that seam.<br/><br/>The dealbreaker, however, is that it significantly reduced the tactile responsiveness of the sleep and volume buttons - they become rather hard to press and you need to really press down in a precise location for it to work. Again, for a case this thin, I would not have expected this to be an issue, but it is. It would have made a lot more sense if there had been cutouts for these buttons instead of a poorly designed enclosure that covers them.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's not crystal clear. From the outside and far away it appears to be, but up close it has a sort of grainy texture (you can feel graininess on the inside) - kind of like a pixelated appearance.

"Safavieh California Shag Collection SG151-1212 Ivory Shag Area Rug, 4 feet by 6 feet (4' x 6')",4.5,Pri,"Just got my rug yesterday and I'm happy to say that the positive reviews are all accurate. Wished I could have seen more photos of the Ivory color before ordering, so I'll upload some of my own!<br/><br/>I'll start with how the rug feels: it is most certainly plush, dense, and high quality. Your feet will just sink into it. It even looks rich and dense. The moment it arrived, my cat began rolling around and playing on it, which brings me to the next point - the smell: it does not have an offensive chemical odor! There is a slight ""new carpet"" smell, but nothing too strong or offensive. If it were strong, I doubt my cat would have decided to nap on it as soon as I lay it down, since cats are sensitive to strong odors. Now, it's been 24 hours since I put down this rug and I honestly, can't even smell it anymore.<br/><br/>The ivory color looks really beautiful when matched with taupe colored furniture, which is what I have; I imagine it'd look great with greys as well, but probably won't go too well with light beige or white furniture (unless you want something totally monochromatic), since there will be too little contrast. I considered this when choosing between ivory and beige, and I'm glad I went with ivory, because any darker and there wouldn't have been sufficient contrast between the rug and my taupe sofa fabric. The ivory color is pretty identical to the one you see in the thumbnail and the photos I've uploaded. It's a warm cream color - I think someone else described it as the color of white chocolate, which I'd say is pretty accurate.<br/><br/>When this rug first arrived the threads were sort of flat, but it fluffed up very nicely once I vacuumed it. My vacuum cleaner itself doesn't work on this even on the highest pile setting because the rug is just too dense and the pile is too high, but using the vacuum's upholstery brush attachment did the job. This won't be difficult for me because my rug is 4 x 6, but if you have a larger size, I imagine it'd be a bit annoying to have to use an attachment every time (unless your vacuum is better than mine and can go over these types of rugs). Vacuuming it when it arrives may also help with the smell a bit in addition to straightening it out a bit from the ripple effect created by having been rolled up.<br/><br/>The last and only somewhat negative point is that the rug does slide around quite a bit on my laminate flooring. I have the front leg of the chaise of my sectional sofa resting on it as well the four legs of my ottoman, but it still slides around when I step onto it. This is in no way a deal breaker, because I looked into rug pads, found them to be pretty inexpensive, and just ordered one, which should take care of this problem. I also imagine the sliding is more of an issue for the smaller rug sizes, because they're not very heavy.<br/><br/>I actually wish I had gone for a larger size, only to have more of my living room covered so there's more area in which my feet can step on the soft fluffiness of this rug  - in the future, when I'm in the market for a larger rug, I am definitely going to be buying the same one in a larger size.",64.54,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"December 20, 2014",Best rug I've ever owned (Ivory 4 x 6),Yes,1,0,39

You can't really tell from the photos, but the green part of the comforter is covered in a light translucent fine mesh fabric with a flocked leaf print which gives it a very elegant ethereal look. The pillows it comes with are beautiful as well.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried that the color wouldn't be the same as the picture because in the photo it looks turquoise/aquamarine, but the description says ""sage"" which is more green. The true color is not too far off from the photo, however; to me it looks better than the photo - I'd describe it as a subtle mint green with a hint of blue.<br/><br/>One thing I am not a fan of however is the fact that it comes with white sheets when it's the lighter color on the comforter is an off-white (almost beige).

PUR 18 Cup Dispenser w/ 1 Filter,4.4,Pri,"This filter truly improves the taste of water - I wasn't expecting such a drastic difference. I recently moved to an apartment in a location where the tap water just tastes and smells really weird and unpleasant. For the past week I had been avoiding water for that reason and reaching for sugary juices instead. But being that I'm pregnant, it's so important to keep hydrated with water and avoid excess sugar. So I purchased this, not expecting a complete transformation in the taste of the water. Now I just want to drink water all day! The taste actually becomes completely clean and fresh with a hint of sweetness coming from the water itself. It's hard to believe it's still the same weird tasting water that I started off with.<br/><br/>Regarding the design - I found it to be a bit larger than I expected and it's too tall for my fridge so I'm going to have to keep it on the counter. It's pretty easy to assemble, but a bit cumbersome to wash, but that disadvantage is offset by the fact that you don't have to refill it as frequently.

iloome iPhone 5 / 5S / 5C ScreenMate Real Tempered Glass 9h Hardness Premium Screen Protector with Round Edges &amp; Oleophobic Coating,3.8,Pri,"The first thing to know about glass screen protectors in general is that they will add bulk to your phone especially if you're using them with a case. I was, however, expecting this to go on much better, without forming bubbles, because it is glass as opposed to a film. Out of the box, I noticed right away that there are some imperfections on the glass. Little tiny scuff marks and things stuck to the glass that won't come off. I consider myself very good at applying screen protectors because I have never gotten bubbles when applying the plastic screen protectors that I buy from Spigen. This one however got a lot of bubbles under it. and when i lifted it up to take off the dust, the screen protector was pretty much ruined. I feel like I should have gone with Spigen's glass screen protector because I've had so much success with their plastic ones. The quality of this one doesn't seem to be worth the price, because after a month or so, it just seemed that the screen quality degraded over time as it collected particles that couldn't be wiped off and was easily scratched.",26.88,3.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 9, 2013",Not that impressed,Yes,2,0,32
"iPhone 5S Screen Protector, Spigen Clear Steinheil Screen Protector for iPhone 5S/5 - 2 Pack - Ultra Oleophobic film cover shield for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, International - Oil Resistant / CLEAR (SGP08198)",3.9,Pri,"Two things have compelled me to write this review:<br/>1) my interest in how this Oleophobic screen protector (the pink one) compares to the Ultra Crystal (the blue one)<br/>2) The reviews that claim that these screen protectors don't apply properly, are difficult to align, and all other issues pertaining to application.<br/><br/>So to address the first point, I think Spigen should just get rid of the Ultra Crystal and have the Oleophobic as their main screen protector. This is because the Ultra Crystal is extremely prone to smudges which I have found are very difficult to wipe off; they require using a specific type of cloth to wipe off smudges. Meanwhile the Oleophobic preserves the screen resolution and visibility in exactly the same way as the ultra crystal while being significantly less smudge prone. And whatever smudges it does collect can be easily wiped off (even with your finger actually). I also like how the screen feels with the oleophobic.<br/><br/>I have also tried the matte screen protector by Spigen and while I liked that one as well, I soon tired of the slightly grainy appearance of the screen. I think the oleophobic is definitely a better option for someone who wants to enjoy the beautiful screen of the iphone 5 without having to deal with the smudges that form over the ultra crystal and the naked screen. I've found actually that the ultra crystal collects more smudges than even the naked screen.<br/><br/>The second issue is application and I have not had any of the screen protectors I've used by spigen form a single bubble during application. With cheaper quality screen protectors you end up with bubbles no matter what you do. But if these screen protectors are applied correctly, they will not form bubbles. The trick to doing this is to remove every speck of dust off the screen before applying. It's best to do this in a well lit room so you can see even the tiniest speck of dust that collects over the screen. Spigen's screen protectors come with little stickers that you can pick the dust off with. I always go over the naked screen with one of those picking up any dust that might be clinging to the screen with the adhesive side of the sticker. And you have to be quick in applying the screen protector after cleaning the screen, as tiny floating dust particles will settle again within seconds. The screen protector may also form bubbles if one of the edges comes slightly over the edge of the glass. The best way to align it is to first take off the entire film over the adhesive side, hold the iphone sideways and use the home button as a guide. I hold the screen protector with my thumb and index finger on all four corners and I match up the corners with the iphone's corners and make sure the home button fits perfectly into the circle cutout and that the camera cutout also fits perfectly over the front camera. I've had perfect application each time with three different varieties of Spigen screen protectors I've used by employing these methods.<br/><br/>With these screen protectors you definitely do get what you pay for. And oleophobic is definitely the best choice. It does feel tacky at first immediately upon application, but within 24 hours of use the tackiness is completely gone and the screen feels perfectly smooth.",9.99,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 9, 2013",The oleophobic screen protector and how to avoid bubbles during application,Yes,5,4,31
"iPhone 5S Case, Spigen Neo Hybrid EX Slim Metal Case for iPhone 5/5S - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate (SGP10037)",3.5,Pri,"I'm pretty confused by the reviews that say the quality/fit of this case is poor. I just received my case and the fit is perfect and the quality is also great. I do think however that $32 for a bumper is very overpriced, and would rather buy the bumper alone and not have all the accessories that come with it, especially since I ended up using only the back protector, and had to order the matte screen protectors separately, because the clear ones are fingerprint magnets and I hate fingerprints.<br/><br/>But so far I have to say I'm really liking Spigen's products. Their matte screen protectors, though overpriced, are far superior to the cheap ones you buy in bulk. I also ordered a case that came with a screen protector for the Note II and I have to say the best thing about their screen protectors is that they go on very easily and smoothly; none of the screen protectors have bubbles underneath.<br/><br/>As for the bumper itself, the metal slate one is the best match for the black iphone 5. It's a little more on the grey side when you compare it to the aluminum on the iphone, which has a slight blue tint to it. But you can't even notice the difference. What I love is that it has lay on the table feature on both the back and front. And the bumper doesn't move around at all; I can tell that it will stay on and protect both sides if it falls. I haven't noticed any interference with the sound quality either. It just feels like a strong sturdy bumper made of good quality materials. It's smooth to the touch all over, so you don't really miss the feeling of the naked iphone. It definitely does cut out a lot of the bulk that most cases add to the phone, yet it's definitely way more protective than those ultra thin cases that leave the top and corners exposed, as those areas are most likely to get scuffed or impacted if the phone falls.",9.99,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"January 15, 2013",Great quality bumper and excellent screen protectors,Yes,5,4,30

"Sharp CV2P10SC 10,500 BTU Portable Air Conditioner w/ Remote - Manufacturer Reconditioned",3.2,Pri,"So my frustration with this air conditioner has been steadily increasing over the past 2 months and I am writing this review after experiencing the worst of this poorly designed contraption.<br/><br/>I have central air in my house but the second floor doesn't receive central air (whoever designed the system in my house was a moron clearly) and during the summer it becomes intolerable upstairs with temperatures as high as 100 degrees on very hot days. Unfortunately for me, my bedroom happens to be on the second floor so I bought this AC last year. The reason I can't get a window unit is because I have awning style windows that I can't fit an AC into. The reason I didn't want a wall unit is because cutting a hole into the wall would mean the winters might end up being even colder upstairs (heat doesn't reach upstairs either). SO I settled for this portable AC.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this AC is the horrible draining system. The unit weighs at least 100 pounds, impossible for my 110 pound self to lift on her own. Being that the unit is on the second floor I can't carry it outside to drain. Thankfully, last year I only had to drain it once. This year however, everything that can possibly be wrong with the AC is wrong with it. For one thing, in order to make draining possible, I tried setting it on a stack of cardboard. But because cardboard isn't level, the AC would make this horrible groaning sound making it impossible to sleep with it on. Many times in the night I would wake up thinking I was in hell because the sound it would make can only be heard in hell. So I finally figured out that the problem was the cardboard not being level so I had to take it off the cardboard.<br/><br/>Finally the noise stopped and now the sound of the AC is tolerable. However with that problem out of the way the lack of cardboard made draining the AC impossible so I figured I can raise it up on 3 inch blocks of wood to drain it. Doing this involved tilting the AC which somehow caused the bottom of it to leak water, soaking my carpet. And to make the situation even more frustrating, when I finally got it on the wooden block with the help of another person, a small trickle of water poured out and then stopped. Turns out, you have to tilt the AC back in order for all the water to pour out. If you don't get all the water out, it will stop working every day and when you try draining it only a trickle will come out. Ugh.<br/><br/>Tonight at 3 a.m. the AC stopped working even though I drained it yesterday. My attempt to drain it caused half the water to soak into my carpet. Finally out of desperation I figured out a sort of solution to this problem. I dragged it to the top of the staircase, and placed a basin on the first step right below the step that the AC was on. This way, the AC was elevated above the basin and I was able to tilt it and finally get all the water out. Hopefully it doesn't get full again for a while. So this may be a useful thing to do if you've got the AC on the second floor and it indicates that it needs to be drained too frequently. Most likely it's because you aren't able to get all the water out due to its faulty design.<br/><br/>Apart from this tedious draining process, I can say that the AC in unnecessarily bulky taking up way too much room and don't expect ""library quiet"" even if you've got it on level ground. And it doesn't cover nearly as much area as it says it does.<br/><br/>Overall, this AC sucks. Unfortunately I can't return it anymore. If you've already bought one and can still return, I strongly recommend you do. If I had known how much this AC would suck I would have cut a hole in my wall without a second thought and installed a wall unit. This unit will cool a small room sufficiently, but that doesn't make up for the hassle of draining it.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In the past two days I have had to drain this AC at least 10 times. Basically every 2-3 hours. So no there is no way that not properly draining it was the reason it was full every 2 hours. Basically all you need to know is, you will be lugging 100 lbs around every 2 hours to drain and waking up in the middle of the night covered in sweat because the AC has shut down on you because the teeny tiny compartment in which water collects is full. You end up putting WAY more work into this AC than you get out of it. It is difficult to articulate in words how frustrating this piece of junk is.",27.99,1.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"July 2, 2012",POS.

N/A,N/A,Pri,"So first of all I want to say that it's amazing how these treats compare to the Halo freeze dried chicken treats. You can pay about $9 or $10 for a 2.2 oz container of the Halo treats or you can pay a few more dollars for these Whole Life treats and get twice the amount. So naturally I chose these. While Halo seems to have marinade as an extra ingredient in their treats, these are 100% pure chicken, which is good because I don't think cats need marinade in their meat. I also like that they're made in the USA.<br/><br/>The thing about freeze dried chicken is that it is 100% healthy because it's a 100% chicken. And the best thing is cats seem to prefer it over any and all other treats. My cat is on the small side and she's a very finicky eater and I often worry that she isn't getting enough nutrition. With these I can supplement her diet to ensure that she gets enough protein. In the bag there are a lot of large pieces as well as smaller bite-sized pieces. I crush the small ones to put over her food or feed dry and I soak the larger pieces in warm water. Since my cat won't eat wet food, giving these soaked is the perfect alternative as she seems to love them even more soft. Upon being soaked, they soften into a meaty texture right away.<br/><br/>Overall, freeze dried chicken is the best treat you can give your cat and the size and price that these come in is perfect.

"Comfy Cone Pet E-Collar, Large, Black",4.1,Pri,"Ok before I begin this review, I want to clarify that this gets one star not because it's poor quality or anything, but rather, because it is marketed as a more COMFORTABLE alternative to the plastic e-collar. It isn't.<br/><br/>While the cushioning this cone provides may be preferred by some animals over the rigidity of the plastic cone, for small animals, this is going to be more uncomfortable. There is no way the cushion on the smaller cones would not push against the sides of the animal's face making it hard for them to move their head around. Another thing is, the smaller cones would not be bendy at all because of all that cushioning. While this item may be suitable for larger dogs, as it allows a lot more space around the face area and the cone would just be larger overall, it isn't suitable for a cat. The thickness of the cushion is the same in a large cone and in a small cone, so while it is suitable in one that is larger, it just adds bulk and rigidity to a small one.<br/><br/>This cone for a cat would probably be the equivalent of a human wearing a neck-brace, except this extends into the sides of the face so it's worse. For my cat, I ordered the Kong EZ soft e-collar and it works better for my cat, because she is small and I wanted something that allows her more room to move her head around while still preventing her from licking.",27.20,1.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 23, 2012",NOT for cats.

"KONG EZ Soft E-Collar for Cats and Dogs, Extra-Small",3.8,Pri,"Let me just start off by saying that I gave this collar 5 stars mostly to rate how much better it is than your conventional hard plastic collar. I don't think this collar is perfect, but it is the best alternative there can be to the dreaded cone.<br/><br/>I want to write this review because when I was debating whether or not it would be worth my money to purchase this, the few reviews there are for this only served to confuse me more. Some people hate it, and others love it, and then there's obviously the picture someone posted of this collar having been chewed through by their cat. I'm hoping this review will address some of the things people may be wondering before purchasing this.<br/><br/>I ordered this because my cat has an injury on her paw and she keeps licking the scab and drawing blood. I only wish I had ordered this collar immediately after she got spayed so that I wouldn't have had to go through the pain of constantly readjusting the bodysuit I made for her to make sure she couldn't take it off. I had to get crafty, because the hard cone she was supposed to wear stressed her out so much. The cone was making her disoriented on top of how weakened she was from surgery. If I had this collar, I would have had a much easier time and not have had to devise alternatives to the cone.<br/><br/>Here are some things to keep in mind when buying this:<br/><br/>1) MATERIAL: It is soft and bendy, but not flimsy; it will remain in a cone-like shape around the cat's head. I have not experienced a problem with the drawstring clip yet. The inside of it is reinforced so that a relatively calm cat, who doesn't go wild when a cone is placed around its head, wouldn't be able to figure out a way or have the drive to chew through it. Based on the way the cone fits around my cat's head, I don't think she would be able to get it in her mouth in such a way that she could chew it, which brings me to the size of the cone.<br/><br/>2) SIZE: I have a very small cat. She has most likely reached her adult size, as she is almost a year old, but she maintains a weight of 7.7 pounds. So you can imagine that her neck is tiny. The extra small size fits her quite snugly. If you have a cat who is larger than 10 pounds, I would suggest going with size small. I've read one review written by someone who says size small was too big for their cat who weighs 13 pounds. While the cone itself might be too long or whatever, the neck size of extra small probably will not fit a 13 pound cat.<br/><br/>3) DESIGN: One of the biggest problems with this cone, perhaps, is that the only way to put it on your cat is to put it over their head. It's sort of like putting your head through a t-shirt with a really small neck. Except with this, you're putting it over a cat's head. Obviously, because your cat won't want anything to do with this strange object being placed around its head, it will struggle. I would suggest having another person hold the cat while you slide it over its head. I understand that for this sort of collar, there's not much that can be done differently in terms of design, but it is something to take into consideration when determining size. My cat has a small head. If your cat doesn't have a small head, the extra small size simply won't go over its head.<br/><br/>4) COMFORT: After I put this on my cat's head, she actually went to her water bowl and began drinking. With the plastic cone, she cannot eat or drink. The bendiness of this allows cats to be able to eat which is a big plus. And later, I saw her lying down on her cat tree, which she never does with the plastic cone, because it's too bulky and she can't jump on while she is wearing it. She usually sulks and becomes limp with the plastic cone. With this one, she is walking normally. Also, note, that any type of e-collar, unless it is completely transparent is going to hinder the cat's peripheral vision. This one has more of a problem in that sense, because it is green. This takes away from the comfort factor, obviously, but here I am comparing the comfort level of this collar to the plastic cone. When wearing the plastic cone, cats will frequently bump into walls and doors and get more freaked out as a result of that. With this one, even if the cat bumps into something, it does not make a scary noise and the fabric does not crinkle either. Also the plastic cone my cat was wearing (I guess it was worse than others) sort of hung on the top of her head, so she felt as though there was a weight on her head, so she would walk with her head hung low, almost dragging the collar. This one stays perked up on its own, and does not put weight on my cat's head.<br/><br/>The last thing I want to say is that this review is based on the relief I am feeling only a few hours after putting this on my cat. I just started using it a few hours ago. If I find that she was able to chew it or take it off, I will update, but so far, it doesn't look like she'll be able to remove it or anything.<br/><br/>UPDATE: My cat wore this for one week without any problems. Once we got the hang of putting it on and taking it off her, it became super easy for everyone. She did develop this strange tendency to constantly scratch at it with her hind leg claws and surprisingly, this cone stood up to a week of her doing that without tearing. So I would highly recommend this for cats or small dogs. The recovery process for pets is stressful enough to begin with, so if you want them to be comfortable, I would definitely opt for this over the hard e-collar for small pets.",6.05,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 23, 2012","If you have a cat who isn't too large and is relatively calm, this should work just fine",Yes,,,24
N/A,N/A,Pri,"I had been reading several reviews by people have found mold in these treats as well as comments about the color variations. I was skeptical at first about these comments, since I have bought these treats twice, and never found any apparent problems. However, I did think it was odd that the color of the treats in the second bag I bought was light orange, while the color of the treats in the first bag I bought was dark brown. However, I didn't think much of it since my cat seemed to enjoy both. But then I began reading reviews about how these treats may be a health hazard, so I became worried and stopped feeding them to her.<br/><br/>I ended up taking my cat to a new vet recently and coincidentally it turns out they write a ""treat warning"" on all their receipts which warns pet owners not to feed jerky treats made in china (YES, these *ARE* MADE IN CHINA) to their pets as they have been known to cause kidney disease. So there has to be some truth to all the complaints about these treats. Cats seem prone to kidney disease to begin with; why take chances?<br/><br/>It's true that cats may go crazy for these treats and love them. I know my cat does. But there are other treats she enjoys just as much. I currently have the ""Breathies"" and ""Vita Kitty"" version of these and both are now in the trash, because my cat's life is worth more than a five dollar bag of treats. I wouldn't risk it just because she likes them so much because I have a plethora of other healthy treats she loves.<br/><br/>Oh and for people who think they should continue feeding these because they claim to or seem to have breath freshening benefits, let me tell you, they don't. They do not actually freshen cat breath. In order for a treat to freshen breath, a cat would actually have to chew it. There is no way you can or should be feeding these whole, because your cat will simply choke on them. And when you break them into manageable pieces, your cat will simply swallow them. There. No breath freshening benefits whatsoever. If you want to freshen your cat's breath, brush her teeth. If brushing is impossible, get some of the CET poultry flavored toothpaste, and just let them lick it. It works enzymatically and my cat absolutely loves the flavor. CET also sells chews that are medicated to actually clean your cat's teeth. And just an FYI, your cat's breath will never smell minty fresh or completely odorless, because animals that eat such high protein diets tend to have a certain degree of halitosis.<br/><br/>I am just really glad my vet confirmed that these treats are known to cause health problems. I strongly urge anyone reading this to spend their money on some other treats. Better options are Feline Greenies (they claim to help their teeth and breath, too), Pet Greens, or any kind of freeze dried chicken/turkey treats. There's lots of good stuff out there so don't waste your money on this.",6.05,1.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 17, 2012","""KNOWN TO CAUSE KIDNEY DISEASE IN PETS""; save your money and buy something else",Yes,1,1,23
"Feline Greenies  6-Ounce Package, Chicken",3.9,Pri,"The reason this stuff even gets 4 stars is because my cat absolutely loves these treats. They smell absolutely disgusting to me, so I wonder how they can possibly be improving her breath, but she likes them and they're a better option than giving her Temptations treats, so why not? Plus, a 6 ounce bag lasts several months, which is awesome for the price, especially since this is a by-product/animal digest free treat.<br/><br/>Now, here are my problems with these:<br/><br/>When my cat was younger and smaller, she used to actually chew them, so I figured they might potentially be doing something for her teeth. Now that she is bigger, she just swallows them whole. If these treats were a little larger, then perhaps she would be compelled to actually chew them. I see how it's a tricky matter to make them a size that the cat will actually chew and not choke on, but I do worry about her choking on these. Also, they obviously aren't doing anything for her teeth if she doesn't even chew em, so yeah, that's my main complaint. Apart from that, I wish they didn't smell so horrible, and I wish they didn't have corn in them, but since they're just a treat, I figure a few junk ingredients are allowed, as long as they aren't by-products.",6.99,4.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 11, 2012","Cat loves it, but I wish the size could be improved",Yes,1,1,22
N/A,N/A,Pri,"I ordered this dewormer for my cat because a 2 year supply of this stuff costs less than a single dose at my vet. Pyrantel Pamoate is what most vets administer for roundworms in cats. At the vet, my cat was given Strongid suspension, which I later learned is pyrantel pamoate, so I decided to order some to give her myself, since I don't want to ever wait till the infestation becomes bad enough to make her sick and need to be rushed to the vet again, where I have to pay $40 for a single dose. What's great about this particular suspension is that my cat actually loves the flavor, so it's very easy to feed it to her. She hates the flavor of Strongid and it always had to be force-fed to her; she happily licks up this one. This is the same medicine used to treat pinworms in humans which is why it will say pinworms on the bottle. It doesn't have dosing instructions for small animals, so you'll have to Google how much is appropriate to give your cat based on her weight. Be sure not to overdose as you need less of this stuff in one dose than you'd think. Also if you have only one cat or one small dog, I would recommend getting a smaller bottle of this if you can find it, because based on how much is in the bottle and how much she needs in one dose, I will barely have used any by the time it expires. But I'm not complaining because even if I end up throwing most of it out, I will still have saved money in the end.",6.99,5.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"March 1, 2012",Perfect,Yes,1,1,21

"Tetra 25846 Whisper In-Tank Filter with BioScrubber, 1 to 3-Gallon",3.7,Pri,"This filter is the worst. First problem I had with it is that the airpump's shape is not designed to handle its own vibration. If placed on a wooden surface it will slide until it encounters an object and when it bumps into the object it will make a loud obnoxious noise. So I placed it on some paper towels and it finally stayed in place. Still, this filter was making more noise than the filter I use in my 20 gallon tank.<br/><br/>I put this one in a 2.5 gallon betta tank and after a week I noticed lots of debris floating around in the water which shouldn't be there if you're using a filter. I also noticed that the water flowing out of the filter was down to a trickle. After just ONE week. Apparently the airpump isn't strong enough and loses its ability to function in a week. By the end of week 2 NO water was flowing out of the filter. This filter was a complete waste of money. Seriously, do not buy it.<br/><br/>For anyone who has one of these and finds that it no longer works, here's what you can do with that useless airpump. Use it for a small airstone. That's the only thing it will work for. That's what I did for a while until I got sick of the noise and just ordered a new airpump that is ten times quieter than this thing.",12.49,1.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"February 7, 2012",Stopped working in less than a month.

"Tetra 25816 Whisper In-Tank Filter with BioScrubber, 3 to 10-Gallon",3.7,Pri,"To start off, I'd like to say that this filter doesn't do a bad job with actually filtering the water. In fact, for a month, without water changes, it kept the water crystal clear in my 10 gallon tank. However, when I finally cleaned the tank after a month, I discovered an insane amount of debris in the gravel and had to do a full water change, which was okay only because I use that tank for a betta. It is possible that I just had bad gravel in there at the time and no filter actually sucks out of the gravel, but I feel as though so much debris shouldn't have accumulated at the bottom.<br/><br/>That being said, there are other filters that can do the same while not being problematic in the following areas like this filter is:<br/><br/>1) The suction cups on this filter are terrible. In addition to that, its design is horrible. Basically there's no way of raising the lip of this filter high enough to keep your water level all the way to the rim of the tank. And the suction cups can't seem to properly support the weight of this filter, so it will often fall off.<br/>2) It looks ugly and consumes a lot of space in the tank. The reason I'm taking appearance into account is because the whole purpose of having an aquarium is so that it looks nice. When you place a large bulky object into it, it won't look aesthetically pleasing at all.<br/>3) After only a few months, I began to notice that it keeps alternating between being quiet and loud. So for some time you will hear nothing and then suddenly you start to hear this loud humming noise. Then, after five minutes of making this obnoxious noise it will quiet down again. This is probably my biggest problem with the filter.<br/><br/>My suggestion is to buy the Aquaclear 20 for 10 gallon tanks. It is a much more complex filter and it hangs over the side. The motor is quiet and the intake tube doesn't create the strong current that this filter creates as its sucking water in. It costs a few dollars more, but is totally worth it.",11.57,2.0,A34D626U4JYK99,"February 7, 2012","Difficult to attach to aquarium wall, becomes loud after a few months of use",Yes,9,7,18

The fact that NB offers several grain free varieties at reasonable prices and doesn't have by-products in its ingredients is awesome. I just feel a little uncomfortable because I think green pea is listed as the first ingredient on this, but my cat's never had any problems with this food and it smells a lot better to my nose than most foods out there, so I don't see any reason to switch.

The oil based cores give these such a smooth gliding feel.  It's like the top is almost melted, they have such a wonderful flow.  The colors are so rich and vibrant!<br/><br/>This is my second set of nice colored pencils, the other being a set of watercolor pencils.  If you are really into coloring or creating your own art, I would really recommend a set of each, as they each have advantages and disadvantages.  If you are choosing one over the other, here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>With these oil pencils, it's so easy to create bold colors and to blend.  It's a bit difficult to really get muted, soft colors.  Yes you can color very lightly and you get a light color, but it's not muted, it's still very saturated with color.  I love this for the coloring I am doing with them, but wanted to point it out.<br/><br/>When the arthritis in my hands is flared up, these are a better choice as I get a rich color with very little pressure.<br/><br/>With the watercolor pencils, the ones I have have a soft, smooth choir, but they are still not as fluid feeling as the oil.  They can create soft, muted tones easily, and just add water to the paper or pencil and you instantly have a rich bold color to work with.  The caveat being that you will destroy or damage some papers with even the slightest bit of water.  They blend well, but, in my opinion these oil based ones blend better - for non-water blending.  I am able to get a sharper point on the watercolor pencils, the oils are a bit too soft to get a sharp sharp point.<br/><br/>Overall, these are awesome pencils, with thick, soft cores that make coloring extremely enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was offered the opportunity to purchase this set of colored pencils at a discounted price in exchange for submitting a review of my experience with the product.

My first impression was highly favorable and most of the bricks fit together tightly and fit well with Legos, but not all.  A few of the bricks just would not stay connected well to anything.  This was only the case for a couple of the bricks, but indicates a bit of a quality control issue in my opinion.  This is the reason I'm deducting one star, really I think I'd rate them a little above 4 stars.  If more pieces were bad, I would have dropped stars quickly.<br/><br/>I was impressed that the bag does live up to its claim of having many of the larger bricks, providing smaller bricks more as part of the assortment, not to fill up the total number.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say they are a good value for the current selling price, and if you find them on sale - I think I saw these on lightening deals before Christmas, it's a great value/piece.<br/><br/>These pieces do not match the Lego colors, so if this is extremely important to you, then this won't be the set for you and you will have to stick with name brand.  If you are looking for a way to have a large assortment of bricks to expand your building capabilities, this is a great value.<br/><br/>For those wondering about trusting reviews from those who received a product at a discount, I don't know how others do it but in the program I'm in, I don't know if the manufacturer even sees our review.  I know I am judged on a few things: did I submit a review, was it long enough to be meaningful (a ten word review would count against you), and what percentage of people found it helpful.  I have not seen any implication that rating a product well influences my reviewer rating at all.  I was asked by one manufacturer to say I bought their product on a flash sale instead of being upfront and I ignored that, as it is not truthful.

Thyroid Support Supplement - Essential Care to Aid Hypothyroidism Symptoms - a Complex Blend of Vitamin B12 and Iodine for an Underactive Thyroid and to Increase Energy Levels,4.7,Dragonling's Mommy,"My thyroid was discovered to be a bit sluggish during testing in pregnancy, but not so much that I absolutely had to take anything, but something to watch.  I chose not to treat it at the time, as I was told sometimes it is temporary and I may go back to normal after birth.<br/><br/>I'm still in a limbo position, where I don't have to treat it, but I am not running on optimal.  I was trying to improve my health naturally, but it's been difficult with so little energy.  So, when I was offered this supplement at a discounted price in exchange for submitting a review of my experience with the product, I thought, what can it hurt?<br/><br/>I don't have direct thyroid measurements before and after, but I do seem to feel like I have a little more energy.  I don't know if this could be directly from this supplement or not, but it does seem to at least have a slight affect for me.<br/><br/>The effect is nothing like taking an energy supplement, I do like this better, as I don't feel something giving me false, tense, nervous energy.  On the other hand, I don't feel nearly as much of a boost from it.

Bayam 48 Watercolor Colored Pencils / Professional Water Soluble Colored Pencil Set / Metal Tin Case / 48 Assorted Colors,4.7,Dragonling's Mommy,"I received a few coloring books for Christmas and had been using the makers I had with not quite satisfactory results, so I was excited when I was offered the opportunity to purchase these pencils at a discounted price in exchange for submitting my evaluation of my experience with the product.<br/><br/>I have never used the high-dollar brand name watercolor colored pencils, so unfortunately, I cannot compare to those.  I will describe my experience with three as thoroughly as possible.<br/><br/>Packaging:  The tin they arrived in was fairly nice.  Unfortunately, mine was slightly bent out of shape.  I was considering docking a star, but I think the real issue was Amazon shipping these fairly loose in a box with several other items I ordered.  The tin snaps open and shut and contains two little plastic trays of pencils.  These trays are fairly flimsy themselves, but as they sit in the tin, it provides their support.  There are at least some little spots to easily pinch the top tray to remove it to get to the pencils underneath.<br/><br/>Accessories:  This comes with a blending paint brush to use with these as watercolors and a little pencil sharpener, that looks generic, but worked quite well for me.<br/><br/>Pencils:  These are by far the highest quality I've used and are far above your typical generic pencils.  The color core is slightly soft allowing you to easily color with smooth results.<br/><br/>The three ways I tested then are as a simple colored pencil, color first and then blend lightly with water, and finally, to wet the pencil before marking the paper.<br/><br/>As a simple colored pencil these still outshine your typical colored pencils as they give such smooth coverage.  Lightly blending this with water and the included brush, gives your work a slightly translucent quality.  And when I would wet the pencil first a was rewarded with bold deep color that really stood out.<br/><br/>These worked well in every type of situation I could see someone using them in.  They seem to be a really good value for those looking to step up their coloring, and perhaps learn some new techniques.  If you are an artist, experienced with the pencils that cost three to four times as much, I don't know if you will be disappointed or not, but at this price point, I don't even think these are trying to compete with the very top know brands.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a solid quality set for those on a budget and trying to give themselves more options when coloring.<br/><br/>For those wondering about trusting reviews from those who received a product at a discount, I don't know how others do it but in the program I'm in, I don't know if the manufacturer even sees our review.

Quick, this unit is not.  That is the biggest drawback as far as my experience goes.

I was excited about the opportunity, as my husband works a job where he puts too much strain on his ankles and he is frequently in pain.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this brace will not fit his ankles and feet.  The straps that hold the foot part and ankle part will not attach.  The cross straps for support are perfectly fine and adequate.  I am docking one star for the sizing, as, it seems it will only fit those with fairly narrow ankles and feet.<br/><br/>Since it would not fit him, I tried it on and it does fit my narrow feet perfectly.  It may fit someone with average width, but if your foot or ankle tend to the wider side, I don't think this will be the most comfortable brace for you, and if you have wide feet or ankles, I don't think you could even stretch this to work.  I found it to provide light to perhaps medium support, definitely not more.  it was fairly comfortable for me and I could adjust it properly on myself.<br/><br/>I docked the second start for the horrible smell this thing has coming out of the box!  Now, I'm pretty sensitive to smells, so part of it may just be me, but it had a strong unpleasant smell from the neoprene, I suppose.

8 Pack Bamboo Baby Washcloths - Cloth Wipes Set By Duckery Kid,4.9,Dragonling's Mommy,"Right upfront I want to tell you that I purchased my first set of these at a discounted price, but upon receipt, I have already ordered another set!<br/><br/>We have used cloth diapers for years, two children, one birth through potty training and the second, from the time we brought him home from the hospital and until they finish.<br/><br/>That said, we didn't realize the benefits to cloth wipes until recently.  It's great, you are already washing the diapers, it's nothing to just throw the quotes I'm there as well.<br/><br/>These wipes are exceptionally soft, they are the softest ones that I have purchased.  They are 57% viscose from bamboo, 20% cotton and 23% polyester.  I like products composed primarily from bamboo, as it grows so quickly, even without special treatment and pesticides, it is highly renewable.<br/><br/>These wipes are a slight bit larger than my smallest and a bit smaller than another brand of larger wipes I purchased.  They are quite adequate for cleaning all but the messiest of messes with one dampened wipe.  They are thick enough that even when damp nothing seems to bleed through, so you can fold the wipe in half to use again.<br/><br/>Though they are marketed as baby wipes, they could absolutely be used for other things.  They would be perfect as washcloths or cleaning cloths as well.",18.99,5.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 13, 2016",So soft!!! Ordered another set immediately!!,Yes,1,1,37

I have always had a difficult time sleeping so I was very interested in trying this out when I was offered the opportunity to purchase this bottle of Chamomile essential oil at a discount in exchange for submitting a review and evaluation of my experience with the product.<br/><br/>I've used chamomile tea before and was eager to use and evaluate the essential oil in my diffuser at night.  I am very pleased to report that it has seemed to produce a calming effect and I have felt very relaxed at bedtime and it has been easier to get to sleep.<br/><br/>For this use alone, I'm rating this product five stars, and considering I only use 3 drops per night, this bottle is going to last nearly forever, lol.  It's a bit pricey initially, but the bottle really will last for years.<br/><br/>As far as the scent itself goes, it's a little less flowery that I imagined it was going to be and a little more earthy.  I am next going to try mixing it with my absolute favorite lavender.  I feel the two should mix well and provide more benefit than either alone.",49.99,5.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 12, 2016",Wonderfully calming,Yes,1,1,36

I have always had great results using turmeric to treat inflammation. Unfortunately, with just using it in cooking, I could only use so much before the flavor would become overwhelming, and there are times I don't want the flavor in the dish.<br/><br/>When I was offered the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount, I was pretty excited.  I love that I can now get a larger dose than I used in cooking in a convenient capsule.  I now take these regularly and I am gaining the benefits of turmeric all the time.

"Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask 8.8 Oz - Spa's Premium Quality Facial Cleanser for All Skin Types - 100% Natural Formula, Absorbs Excess Oil and Removes Dead Skin Cells to Reveal Fresh and Soft Skin",4.7,Dragonling's Mommy,"I was a bit skeptical about using a mud mask on my face, I've never used one before, but I've seen others with a dry cracking mask and didn't think it looked comfortable at all.  I'm happy to say that this mask was much more comfortable than I anticipated.  For me, the mask did not dry hard, even after a little more than ten minutes, which I liked.  This may have been due to the humidity level in my bathroom, but I was happy with it.  I rinsed it off in the shower and didn't have any issues removing it.<br/><br/>I don't have issues with acne, but I did like that this seemed to clear up the blackheads I have and definitely helped shrink many of my pores a notable amount.  I have dry sensitive skin and this left my skin feeling a little too tight and a bit dry.  After using my regular moisturizer, my skin felt good and better than usual.<br/><br/>I was offered the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount, and I'm very happy I went ahead and tried it.  I am pleased with the results and will probably be using this about once a week.

"Dreamthinker, 50 Ft Expandable Garden Hose Quick Connect, Comfortable Metal Spray Nozzle, Super Strong, Light Weight Hose (50 Ft)",4.2,Dragonling's Mommy,"I bought this house because I wanted something that wished much less than my current standard house and was easier to manage.  When I was offered the Dreamthinker 50 ft expandable hose at a discounted price in exchange for submitting my review of my experience and evaluation of the product, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to purchase one.<br/><br/>Upon receipt the first this I noticed is that this house is indeed extremely light for its size.  This alone is fantastic!  If you are used to a conventional hose, I think this may surprise you with how light it is.<br/><br/>The other thing to notice is that when there is not water running through it, this hose is not the full length started on your purchased hose, it is much shorter.  It is crinkled up and does not expand to full length until it inflates with water.  In most cases this won't matter, however if you do need your house to be full length prior to turning the water on, this (or any expandable hose) may either not be what you need, or you may need to purchase a larger size to compensate for this issue.<br/><br/>While the quick connect seems to be handy, I'm not sure if I actually like it.  For me, getting the nozzle on correctly has proven fairly difficult.  as this is my first experience with the quick connect system, I'm not sure if it's the way it was meant to be, mine is defective, or user error - possibly a combination.",39.50,4.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 10, 2016",So lightweight!!,Yes,1,1,33

I am happy that I chose to purchase these, and my husband and I will probably be using this supplement fairly regularly.<br/><br/>He has a very physically demanding job and often comes home extremely sore and exhausted.  This supplement has helped him with both muscle recovery and with energy levels.  For myself, it has helped respite my energy levels that have been depleted through nursing.<br/><br/>There are many other things this supplement is known to help with, as L-Carnitine has been studied since the 1930's.

"Calily Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil Set, 10ml - Pack of 14",4.4,Dragonling's Mommy,"I received my first diffuser just recently as a Christmas gift along with a bottle of lavender oil.  This was a nice start, as lavender is probably my favorite scent ever, but it left me wanting to try out other oils.  I was researching a nice starter set of a variety of oils when I was offered this set at a slightly discounted price in exchange for providing a review of my experience with the oils after I have had a chance to try them out and evaluate them.<br/><br/>I very happy that I chose to purchase these, this is a great set and a nice variety for someone just starting into essential oils.  There are a variety of oils for things such as to aid with relaxation, ones that help purify the air and kill germs, ones that help you feel invigorated and energized, ones that help open your airways when you are sick to make breathing easier... and on and on.<br/><br/>If you are already into essential oils, you probably know what you use often and may buy those individually, though if your collection only consists of a few oils, this is a great set to expand your collection.  If you or a friend is just starting into essential oils, this is an awesome starter set.<br/><br/>These oils are not for ingestion, so if you are looking for that, you should not purchase this set.  They do have a very nice scent, and though they may not be pure enough for ingestion, they  smell like high quality oils.<br/><br/>Each bottle contains ten months, though this may not sound like too much, when you are using only two to three drops at a time in a diffuser, or just a few drops per ounce of carrier oil for topical applications, this will still last for quite a long time.  If there are any oils you use constantly, you may end up needing a larger bottle, but you will have plenty in these bottles to figure out which you will use the most.<br/><br/>The oils come in dark amber bottles inside the box to help protect them from the damaging effects of light.  Even with the darkened bottles, I keep them inside the box they came in.  This also keeps them nicely organized.<br/><br/>As stated above, I did purchase this set a discount, but I was not provided any incentive to leave a positive review.",69.95,5.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 9, 2016","Nice variety for a starter set, quality oils with great scents.",Yes,1,1,31

This was perfect as I was looking around for a pair of goggles for my five year old.<br/><br/>These are able to be adjusted to fit perfectly, with adjustments I can make to ensure these continue to fit as my child grows.  These have a great quality silicone and very nice lenses.  These are such an upgrade from the goggles we had before and I don't think we will really go back to cheap generic goggles.<br/><br/>The anti-fog coating on these goggles seems to work fairly well, we haven't had an issue with it yet.  The silicone strap feels nice and won't slip off easily when playing in the water.  The goggles also come with three sizes for the noise piece to customize the distance between the eye pieces to fit your child just right - just try not to lose the larger pieces if you are starting with the smaller ones do that you can still adjust these as your child grows.",24.95,5.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 9, 2016","Great kids goggles, fit well with soft silicone eye pieces",Yes,1,1,30
Mazu 11 Piece Lock Pick Set in Case Bundle with Transparent Padlocks and Ebook Instruction,4.3,Dragonling's Mommy,"I recieved this lock set with the tools in a clear plastic bag and the practice lock and keys in a seperate envelope. There were no actual instruction within the package, but an instructional link is provided so that you can access information to assist you online.<br/><br/>There are nine different tools each with a slight variance for different locks or styles. The metal has some flexability to it and the plastic doesn't feel like it is too durable, but is sufficient for the light duty it serves as a handle. The see through lock is fairly solid and pretty good with which to learn.  Unlike several others, it's did require more than one pin to be held to open, but it was still pretty simple and opened easily. This set is a fairly solid practice in lock picking. I do wish it required a little more skill to open.<br/><br/>The clear lock itself turned into an interesting homeschool lesson in how locks in general work, and that was great in and of itself.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fairly decent introductory set. The tools adon't seem to be made of the  highest grade materials, but they do hold up well for a beginner set. The lock is solid and you should get plenty of pratice out of it with no issues.<br/><br/>I was given the opportunity to purchase this set at a discounted price in order to evaluate its performance and provide a review based on my experience with the lock set.",13.95,4.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 9, 2016",Decent set for an introduction to how locks work as well as basic lock picking.

"AZHEALTH Early Detection Pregnancy (HCG) Test Kit, Super Sensitive Midstream Sticks, 3 Count",4.9,Dragonling's Mommy,"These are a great option for those that want the convenience, accuracy and detection levels of the similar brands name tests, but at a fraction of the cost.<br/><br/>For the least expensive tests, you can get the thin strips in bulk.  But if you want a cost effective way to get the convenience of the brand name pregnancy tests at a lower cost, these got the bill nicely.  So far they have accurately reflected that I am not pregnant, and unfortunately just at this time I cannot say how really they will detect a pregnancy, but I have two of the tests saved up and maybe soon!<br/><br/>The AZHealth Pregnancy Test Kit can detect hCG levels as low as twenty five mIU/ml.  This is as good as the pee strips at the doctor's office and a positive on one would definitely be grounds to going to see your midwife or doctor.<br/><br/>Hopefully I will be able to come back and update this review with a positive test soon!<br/><br/>I was given the opportunity to receive these for free in exchange for providing a review of my experience and evaluation of the product.

They have a thickx sturdy stainless steel shaft with a silicone handle and silicone utensil end.  The only thing negative that I really have to say about the set is that the box they come in looks cheap.  When I first opened the box they were delivered in, I was disappointed, then I took the utensils out of the cheap box and was surprised and very happy with the quality.<br/><br/>The silicone is soft and definitely won't scratch anything you use these on.  This set is replacing our older harder utensils.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I received the option to purchase this set of 6 cooking utensils at a slightly discounted price on the condition that I will provide a review of the product once I have had the opportunity to use and evaluate its performance.  I am so glad I chose to purchase this set!

I chose this as I had not tried Frankincense oil before, but was interested based on my experience with other oils.<br/><br/>This arrived just in time!  I ended up with some nasty sinus congestion and instead of the usual camphor and eucalyptus, I reached for this to add to my diffuser.  While I am most familiar with camphor and eucalyptus, as I have used those since my mom would add them to the vaporizer even when I was little, the frankincense worked similarly in helping to open up my airways.  I'm not sure if I will continue to use this for that reason, but that's just a personal preference for what I'm familiar with.<br/><br/>I do think I may use this in the bath, adding a few drops for skin health.<br/><br/>This is a good quality oil, and the bottle is huge considering you typically will only use a few drops at a time.

i-swim Pro Goggles (Black),4.6,Dragonling's Mommy,"I was impressed with these straight out of the box and even miso after putting them to the test.  The goggles arrived in a nice plastic case that fits them well, is study and had a little twist locking mechanism do that it doesn't accidentally pop open.  They also came with a soft, padded nose plug and a set of ear plugs as well.  This was a nice surprise that I hadn't noticed.<br/><br/>The goggles themselves are extremely comfortable, the soft cushy silicone forms a good seal around your eyes without much pressure at all.  The head band adjusts super easily with a little clip you pinch to move -no more fiddling with feeding the strap through those little buckle looking clasps.  The best part is the easy release clip in the back that just snaps apart with no rolling the strap off your head and the typically ensuing tangled mess that I experience when I don't carefully lift the strap off of my long hair.<br/><br/>These goggles performed perfectly in the water and I did not have any issues with fog.  They were comfortable for extended wear, and while I don't quite know about their claim that you'll forget you are wearing them, they never bothered me at all, and most goggles do.<br/><br/>I received one pair of these for free in order to evaluate them and provide feedback and review.

The cute whimsical colors allow you to quickly and easily identify which knife you are looking for.<br/><br/>My complaint is something I knew about these ahead of time, and therefore I am not docking any stars over it -these have a Teflon coating.  I'm sure most are aware at this point just how toxic Teflon is when ingested, and I really don't want it anywhere around my food.  Now, the Teflon dots need to chip off to be in your food, so these is no problem with these right away, just be vigilant about checking for any signs of wear in the Teflon and replace accordingly.<br/><br/>I was provided a sample set of these knives in order to try them out and provide a review of my personal experience with them.",24.99,5.0,A3LENTSWM0X7LL,"January 7, 2016",Great set of knives at a great price!,Yes,1,1,24

I fall asleep without that drugged feeling I don't like from prescription sleep aids and without the drying effects of allergy medication.<br/><br/>I would rate the performance strictly as a sleep aid a little below prescription medication, but without the weird feeling side effects.  It works better and more consistently than something like allergy medication.<br/><br/>I have noted a decrease in stress, but I'm not sure if that is due to the additional and better sleep or this supplement working in yet another way.

The top hat I had to stretch all the way out, but it did fit, even with our irregular and larger tank.  I would imagine it should fit just about any task, though you may need to fiddle with it a bit.

It has a real-time digital screen so you don’t have to use the view finder if you don’t want to.<br/><br/>In comparing the photos I’ve noticed the following: 1) Sony colors are much more true to the eye. My indoor photos on the Canon always come across as really yellow, but it’s much less the case with Sony/Zeiss. Sony/Zeiss also has a better/more natural contrast. You can see the color comparison on the image I’m posting of the berry garland on the chandelier. 2) The images on the Sony/Zeiss are much sharper as well. This is apparent on all photos I’m posting, but you can really see it on the hose comparison. 3) Canon’s photos have always been washed out and I’ve always had to compensate by lowering the exposure. I don’t have to do this with the Sony/Zeiss. This is most apparent in the iron table images I’m posting.<br/><br/>It’s hard to say if it’s the base or the lens that makes the most difference, but I am happier with the Sony/Zeiss on both aspects — the weight and digital screen of the unit itself and the image quality.

B-pretty Double Ended Stamper Large Small Scraper Nail Art Plate Image Tool,4.2,A. Hamilton,"I recently purchased a bunch of stampers to test, these included. These were among the worst I tested. All 3 of these are hard stampers with no squish to them. The green is the hardest, followed by white, then the red (the one I received was actually pink). When they're this hard, know that you need to roll the design on rather than press it on. Rolling, if not done carefully can lead to smudging. Also, hard stampers are not forgiving on curved nails. It will hit the highest part of your nail and miss the lower areas. I also found that the hard stampers do a bad job at filling in solid areas of designs, but only work well on designs with fine lines. The red (pink) one was the best of this bunch, very similar to the Konad double ended stamper. Although, I prefer the Konad because it is slightly larger.

The only negative is that the larger eyes weren't cut very well so they had to be torn away in parts, leaving an unclean edge.",3.15,4.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"November 1, 2015",Pretty good,Yes,3,3,78
Elegance4beauty(TM) Vogue Durable Wooden Honey Dipper Stick for Honey Jar Long Handle Mixing Stick,5,A. Hamilton,Shipping was fast. Product was a good price and seems fine. I used mine for a Halloween prop (for our family bee theme) so I haven't used it in honey. But it seems solid and like it would work fine. Attaching a picture to show the size.,4.14,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 31, 2015",Seems fine,Yes,3,3,77
Yellow Pattern of the Bee on Honeycombs Sleeveless Skater Dress,3,A. Hamilton,"It worked fine for my Halloween costume (I was honeycomb), but I wouldn't wear it on a regular day. The material is spandex -- stretchy and single layer. The cut around the neck is higher than pictured on the website. The fabric seems to have reached the end of the roll before making it to the shoulders of the dress, so both shoulders had a white strip. I got size small which fit fine. I am 5'3"" and 107lb. I'm giving it 2 stars which is generous, because it fit and worked for Halloween.",16.99,2.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 31, 2015",Meh. Not for everyday use.,Yes,3,3,76
"Revlon ColorStay Liquid Eye Pen, Blackest Black, 0.056 Ounces (Pack of 2)",2.9,A. Hamilton,"Blackest black is my favorite liquid liner. It goes on smooth and dark and is easy to apply. It stays on all day so long as your eyes don't get wet. I absolutely recommend it. However, the color Blackened Brown absolutely SUCKS. It is very sheer, uneven and spreads. I'm including a picture.",14.81,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 31, 2015","Black is awesome, brown sucks",Yes,3,3,75
"Star Wars Press-and-Stamp Cookie Cutters, Set of 4 Vehicles: Death Star, Millennium Falcon, Vader's Tie Fighter, X-Wing Fighter",5,A. Hamilton,Great cookie cutters/stampers. They're just as nice as the Williams-Sonoma character set (same size and quality). I have to say that the x-wing looks pretty phallic though.,14.81,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015","They're great, but phallic lol",Yes,1,1,74
Dealglad® 100pcs Halloween Funning Plastic Black Realistic Spider Decoration Prop Joking Toys,5,A. Hamilton,They're good spiders. You get a lot for the price. They're similar to the type you get in Halloween spider web packages or on the spider rings. Realistic size. The bottom has a little piece sticking out of the body. Worked well for our needs.,6.99,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015","Good spiders, good price",Yes,1,1,73
Zoya Remove Plus Nail Polish Remover 32 oz,4.8,A. Hamilton,I've always used Sally Hansen or generic brand (up and up) remover. The other brands either did a sub-par job at removing polish or left my nails dried out and brittle. This polish takes off the polish with ease and my nails are looking so much healthier!! I'll be getting this from now on.,14.50,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015",I'll never use another again,Yes,,,72
"Best Quality Cheesecloth 43 Sq Ft *Chef Premium FOOD GRADE 60* Fine Mesh Unbleached 100% Cotton - Can Use as Nut Milk Bag, Strainer, Baby Wrap Roll",4.4,A. Hamilton,"We used this for Halloween. We wrapped it around a skeleton and around foam balls. We also tore some to make webs. It's higher quality than we needed for this project, but it was the best price we could find for the amount. Because it was nicer quality and a finer weave, it was a bit difficult to tear for the webbing but we got it to work. Our project took 2 packages.",11.99,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015",Used for Halloween,Yes,1,1,71
"33-pack (1"") 1 Inch Black Matte Metal Curtain Rings with Clips (33 Drapery Rings with Clips)",4.2,A. Hamilton,"They are the right size for my curtain rod. They're able to hold my heavy drapery fabric + blackout without issues. Eight clips is the perfect amount of clips per panel so this is enough for 4 panels / 2 windows. Good deal on price, comparable to IKEA.",19.95,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015",Great!,Yes,3,3,70
Scallop Sea Shell Nautical Beach Decor Nightlight,4.4,A. Hamilton,"It's a nice light. It's a white shell with a bit of shine on it. The bulb lets off a warm yellow glow. It's not too dim or bright. Perfect for a night light for my son's nautical room. It would be nice if it turned on with a darkness sensor, but my son enjoys turning it on before bed and off when he wakes up.",9.50,5.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 26, 2015",Good night light for a toddler,Yes,3,3,69
6pc Artificial Granny Smith Apple Apples - Plastic Green Fruit - Six Pieces,3.3,A. Hamilton,"Based on the price and other reviews I knew these weren't going to look great. However, I just needed them to make some fake rotten fruit for Halloween so they'll work fine for me. But if you're buying for everyday use here are some things to know. 1) The stems are loosely set into a hole on top of the apple. They can be pushed in or pulled out easily. It is far from seamless or natural looking. On a couple of them the apple skin is peeling off around the stem hole. 2) The apples will be dented. They're made of foam so this is inevitable. 3) The size is pretty close to the size of an actual apple. 4) The color is bright green. I am posting a picture of one next to an expensive high quality apple that I purchased from Molbaks. 5) Mine arrived in 13 business days. This was 5 business days before the minimum estimated delivery.",3.56,2.0,APJKXPVVM1QQU,"October 15, 2015","Pretty bad, but hey they're cheap!",Yes,3,3,68
N/A,N/A,A. Hamilton,"Well, it was a good price, the cords looks nice and (the first one) functioned fine for 2 weeks...until it suddenly stopped working. I tried flipping the connector, bending the cord at different angles and tried another outlet, but it was completely dead. Good thing it came with 2 more. I just started the 2nd cord last night so we'll see how long this one lasts. When I compare the dead cord to the working
