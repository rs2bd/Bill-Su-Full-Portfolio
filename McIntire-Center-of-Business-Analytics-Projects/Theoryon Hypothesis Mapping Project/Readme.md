In this project I took part in assisting the construction of a psychology hypothesis theory visualization website called TheoryOn. 
http://theoryon.org/

My duty was to wrangle and clean multiple hand-generated excel documents into structured data tables and figure out an algorithm to systematically map different variables within each hypothesis, which include moderating variables, mediating variables, independent variables and dependent variables. 

The results of the algorithm are then feed into a javascript document in which the connections are visualized with vis.js library.
